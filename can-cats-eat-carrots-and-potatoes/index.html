<p>Ferrets cannot digest raw vegetables or fruits and do not give them any nutritional value. Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they require a substantial amount of meat in their diets. Cats are omnivorous which means they can eat the same vegetables we eat. The short answer is yes, carrots are healthy food for cats, but there are ways you can prepare them that are not so healthy. Unlike humans, who are omnivores, cats are obligate carnivores.</p>
