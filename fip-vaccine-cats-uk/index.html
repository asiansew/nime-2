<p>A high proportion of cats (up to 40% of the general population, but up to 100% of cats in multicat colonies) will have been exposed to coronavirus at some point in their life. It is a contagious virus, with the majority of its cases observed in multifeline households, catteries, and shelters. Fip is an uncommon, fatal, viral disease caused by an infection from mutated fcov. Finally, sick cats may not produce antibodies, so they may also test negative. There is no effective vaccine against fipv.</p>

<p>The mutation occurs within the individual cat and there is scant evidence that the deadly fip form of the virus spreads efficiently between cats, although recent shelter outbreaks suggest that. When should i get my cat vaccinated? The exact vaccine will differ year on year depending on the vaccine schedule, but all cats require vaccination against at least one disease annually. 2 herrewegh aa, vennema h, horzinek mc, rottier pj and de groot rj.

<p>Feline infectious peritonitis (fip) is a viral disease that occurs worldwide in wild and domestic cats. Feline infectious peritonitis (fip) is a fatal disease suffered by cats and kittens. A vaccine exists to prevent fiv infection in america, but its use is controversial and itï¿½s not available in the uk. It typically strikes kittens and young cats under 2 years of age, or older cats whose immune system has been stressed or otherwise compromised. 2 herrewegh aa, vennema h, horzinek mc, rottier pj and de groot rj.</p>
