<p>It comes down to your priorities as the cat owner watching out for your cat’s diet. Bananas are not toxic to cats, so they are entirely safe to eat in moderation. Cats can eat bananas but only small pieces. However, if they do eat too much of a banana, they could become constipated and uncomfortable for a couple of days. Cats can only absorb fiber.</p>

<p>Cat owners who choose to give their cat a banana must watch closely for an allergic reaction. These are a good source of vitamins b6 and c, potassium, and carbohydrates. Namely, just because your cat can eat a banana, might not mean that he should. Although there is nothing toxic in bananas for cats, they offer no nutritional value, and they may even cause digestive issues like vomiting, diarrhea. The cooked cereal will be a good option.</p>
