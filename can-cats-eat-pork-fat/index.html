What makes pork detrimental to the health of cats is its nutritional content. Fat, both cooked and uncooked, can cause intestinal upset, with vomiting and diarrhea. Pet owners put the life of their dogs in complete danger when they offer pork fat to dogs.</p>

<p>Small amounts of cooked pork are safe, even nutritious, treats for healthy adult cats, but raw pork is a health hazard, and cats should not be allowed to eat any amount of it. Pork fat globules are too large. Table scraps often contain fat trimmed off of meat and bones. But pork and its counterparts — like bacon and ham — are loaded with sodium, fat and calories that our cats should receive in very small doses. Pork is also rich with a type of fat that is difficult for dogs to digest, which can lead to indigestion and inflammation of the pancreas.</p>
