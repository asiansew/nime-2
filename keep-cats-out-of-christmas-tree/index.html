<p>My cats didn�t care for the christmas tree. Here we look at the dangers to look out for and how to keep your cats and dogs safe around the festive trees. In general most cats detest citrus and will keep their distance. It can be used on other potted. Fence it off if your cats can’t be warded off, you may need to fence off the tree.</p>

<p>Here we look at the dangers to look out for and how to keep your cats and dogs safe around the festive trees. As mentioned above, cats love jumping on trees, so be sure to set the tree up so that it won’t easily topple over. To keep your cat away from the tree, try placing orange peels below the tree and/or in the branches. Burch suggested spraying pine cones with citronella oil and placing them. I found one of my cats 1 time on the branch, he was scolded and it never happened again for 17 years.</p>

<p>Try placing citrus peels like oranges and lemons under your tree skirt. Fence it off if your cats can’t be warded off, you may need to fence off the tree. Christmas trees, whether real or artificial, can be a hazard for homes with pets during the holiday season. Consider the type of tree to buy when it comes to buying a christmas tree, i prefer and love real trees. Pour apple cider vinegar in a spray bottle.</p>
