<p>Siamese cats don‚Äôt always get along with other pets, but this isn‚Äôt usually a problem. Often referred to as the ‚Äúlonghaired siamese,‚Äù the balinese looks like an unlikely candidate for a hypoallergenic cat breed. In fact, this usually very vocal kitty sheds much less than other cat breeds. Although its short hair can cause an allergic reaction, finding a lot less hair in the home really helps those people who are sensitive to feline allergens to not develop symptoms. It is required that we meet the cat before paying and rehoming as we have someone with moderate allergies.</p>
