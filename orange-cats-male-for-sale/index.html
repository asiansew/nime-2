<p>Females that carry the orange gene on only one x chromosome are tortoiseshell in color. First of all, we do know why most orange cats are male. Up to 80% of orange cats are male and nobody knows why. Orange tabby cats are almost always male. Orange tabby cats are about 80/20 male to female.</p>

Mama says she’s seen a lot of female orange tabbies. “as the frequency of the orange gene is much less than the frequency of the black gene in the general cat population, the chance of having two orange genes is much. While female cats will inherit an orange coat only if they carry the orange gene on both x chromosomes, if a male carries the orange gene at all, he will be orange, says konecny. One orange (boy 1) make and one tortoiseshell female (girl 2) are polydactyl.</p>
