<p>Cat‚Äôs eyes will always dilate periodically. Miss kitty is three years old. Is he taking any medications? This means that in the early stages of illness, often the only thing that a cat owner may notice is that the cat has become quiet and withdrawn. But occasional dilation can be caused by contentment, excitement, and most often the level of light in her surroundings. Brain scans are needed if a primary brain disorder, such as a tumor, is suspected.</p>
<h3 id="are-your-cat039s-eyes-dilated-all-the-time">Are your catÔøΩs eyes dilated all the time?</h3><p>Constricted pupils can indicate your cat is agitated or angry. Anisocoria is a sign of an underlying disease condition and therefore there are several different causes. Also, his pupils are almost round all the time. During the day their pupils are small because their eyes donÔøΩt need that much light, at night the pupil opens up to let in all available light so they can see in the dark. At best theyÔøΩre almond shape in bright light. If you have a cat with one dilated and one is not, there are a number of things that could be wrong.</p>

<p>Constricted pupils can indicate your cat is agitated or angry. My house is quite dim, even with lights on, so this may be the cause but looking back through photos to the summer, they were constricted when they were supposed to be (and also in real direct sunlight now). Cats can also get primary hypertension. My dog‚Äôs pupils are always dilated if the dog has both pupils dilated and does not see well, it is possible that they are suffering from sards (sudden acquired retinal degeneration syndrome). This means that in the early stages of illness, often the only thing that a cat owner may notice is that the cat has become quiet and withdrawn.</p>

<p>In the day a catÔøΩs pupil (the black part) is really small because their eyes are made for excellent night vision. When i turned to check on miss kitty, i happened to look at her eyes and noticed that her right eye is completely dilated. She is a very lazy cat so she doesnÔøΩt get excited much. At best theyÔøΩre almond shape in bright light. During the day their pupils are small because their eyes donÔøΩt need that much light, at night the pupil opens up to let in all available light so they can see in the dark.</p>

<p>Dilated pupils can signify serious infection, head or brain trauma or tumor, poisoning, or disease and will need diagnostic tests to determine the cause. Are your catÔøΩs eyes dilated all the time? Dilated eyes (actually the pupils) look like the eyes in the photo below. I have watched her closely and her eyes are the same whether she is inside lazying around or. About a week now, heÔøΩs a ferel cat i rescued, had him 2 years, about 3 months ago started staying out more then being in the house ja:</p>

<p>Can you tell me a little more about the catÔøΩs situation? Her overall health is good. Watch for signs of discomfort such as squinting or rubbing, as well as redness and discharge. My cat was injured 2 months ago and from the injury her right pupil is always dilated. My house is quite dim, even with lights on, so this may be the cause but looking back through photos to the summer, they were constricted when they were supposed to be (and also in real direct sunlight now).</p>
