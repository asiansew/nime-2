<p>Most types of animals can be found here. Cats are visibly smaller than ocelots despite sharing the same model. Eucalyptus is often referred to as eucalypt in european nations. They can be found in their wild form, ocelots , in jungle biomes, and can be tamed with raw fish. Maybe wolves themselves could come in different types (and then they will keep that type/breed when tamed), or wolves could stay the same but become a random dog breed when tamed.</p>
