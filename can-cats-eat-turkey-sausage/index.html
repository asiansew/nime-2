<p>A sausage is okay for the cat to eat or not, it depends on the ingredients are used to make a specific sausage. It’s actually cured in a process similar to aging c. Some pet owners prefer this. Cats can eat plenty of human foods such as brown rice, meat, eggs, and vegetables. You can also hide pills inside for the cat who doesn’t want to swallow a pill.</p>
