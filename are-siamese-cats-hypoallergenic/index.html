<p>In truth, there is no such thing as truly hypoallergenic cat. This is actually a defect so most breeders will select against this. But for now, there is no real research to support this. No animal can be 100% hypoallergenic, however. Siamese cats are extremely intelligent and loyal, who will often form close bonds with one particular member of the family.</p>

<p>The following breeds are considered to be some of the top hypoallergenic cats and are ideal for pet lovers that have highly sensitive allergies towards cats. As far as we know, balinese cats could potentially be hypoallergenic. Despite the long coat, siamese shed less and that is the reason it is often counted as a hypoallergenic breed. Are siamese cats good or bad for allergies? Cats do produce pet dander, a common allergen, but the culprit for the estimated 10 percent of the population who are allergic to cats may be a protein, fel d 1, that is present in cat saliva.</p>

<p>In the 1900s, siamese cats participated in various cat shows and today, occupies the top place among short haired cat breeds. Truth be told, there are no hypoallergenic cat breeds. Indeed, looking online, it seems some cats are actively being promoted as being hypoallergenic but the problem with this is similar to the old chinese whispers. Siamese cats cause less allergic reactions than other cats. When people think of hypoallergenic cats, the first one they tend to bring up is the sphynx.</p>
