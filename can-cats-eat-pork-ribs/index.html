<p>Some sources claim that dogs being descended from wolves have an inherent and natural requirement for raw meat and bones to be a part of their diet. At food fur life and in our raw feeding for ibd cats group we often recommend pork loin as a starter meat when introducing raw food to cats. Before you give your dog pork products, it’s best to check out what is and is not allowed. After all, it can be hard to know which items of human food are safe for your dog to eat. Bacon comes from pigs but curing bacon takes a lot of salt which is unhealthy.</p>

<p>Keep spare ribs for human consumption only. Raw pork loin can be a really good source of protein for your cat as can boneless ribs, rump or the shoulder. Is it safe for cats to eat? When a bone is cooked though, it becomes brittle and can splinter. Serve with the ribs with a creamy side like baked beans, collard greens, polenta, or mashed potatoes as it’s easy to eat and swallow and gives your baby a little break from working on the ribs.</p>
