<p>A very bright planetary nebula in the constellation of draco. The right ascension is the angular distance of an object along the celestial equator from the march equinox. The cat’s eye nebula is a famous planetary nebula located in the northern constellation draco. As we zoom in we see first an image constructed from the digitized sky survey 2, then an image taken by the nordic optical telescope and finally the nasa/esa hubble space telescope image. The dying star appears to have ejected its material to form the nebula at intervals of a few hundred to a few thousand years.</p>
