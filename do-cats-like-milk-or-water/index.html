<p>When i give my cat milk, it�s usually a few drops i put on my finger. Actually it depends on the cat because my cat only likes water but there are many cats that love the taste of milk. What they need to drink more of is water! Both they and us need calcium, or we�ll get a deficiency. However, just because they like it doesn�t mean they should be given milk all.</p>

<p>Cats love the taste of milk because it is high in fat. However, this milk often contains the following unhealthy ingredients: “we generally recommend that cats be fed no more than 20 to 30 calories a day from unbalanced sources, such as human food. Like people, cats associate certain flavors and scents with positive memories, so milk is like comfort food for them. There�s little reason to force a cat to do something it doesn�t want to do.</p>

<p>Cats do like milk, but, like all animals, feeding them milk will make the very, very sick. Why do cats like milk? How do cats drink water. Like cow’s milk, plant milk contains a lot of water, added b vitamins, and added calcium. Some cats don’t like water that is sitting in a bowl.</p>

<p>Some cats prefer moving water rather than drinking from a bowl, so using a cat fountain may encourage her to drink more. You may have heard that cats don’t like water. Some breeds of cats are actually known for enjoying swimming, such as the turkish van, which has been nicknamed “the swimming cat” for that reason. Most cats are actually lactose intolerant, and while a bowl of milk occasionally may not harm them, it is better to give them nice regular water instead. Unlike us, humans, who can create suction in order to get the liquid into our mouths, cats can’t do that so they use fluid mechanics to drink water in an efficient way.</p>

It can be bad for them. Milk contains lactose which cats cannot digest so result is diarrhoea and stomach cramps,so only offer cat milk which has the lactose removed this is fine for them, even if only offered once a.</p>
