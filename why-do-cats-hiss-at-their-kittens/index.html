<p>For example, my neighbors had a kitten that started coming to my house. Unfamiliar objects in the house that move strangely may trigger your cat to hiss or be fearful. It doesn’t matter that they are indoor only cats; Finally, when kittens are weaning at about 4 weeks of age, their mother will hiss at them to discourage suckling. Like most mammals, mother cats are extremely protective of their babies.</p>

<p>My cats go ballistic growling, screaming bloody murder and swatting at the windows when a feral cat comes too close to the house. But if they feel backed into a corner or unable to avoid the aggressor, cats will often hiss and swat to keep them from coming closer. She isn�t abusing her kittens: A mother cat will hiss at her kids to warn them of impending danger. Cats can even be territorial of areas that aren’t part of their kingdom.</p>

<p>This can be true even of very sociable cats during gentle interactions. It�s really upsetting to me. Territorial aggression when a cat hisses at a new cat or kitten, she is expressing a form of territorial aggression. This can happen in the following situations: I have three cats, all littermates, and the only female named tinker just had five kittens.</p>

<p>So, while all cats have their own unique personalities and quirky behaviors, i have no doubts you can create a harmonious home for everyone with a little time and attention to their needs. Your ‘old’ cat, the one that. Hissing is a defensive position. A hissing cat does sound like a snake. Unfamiliar objects in the house that move strangely may trigger your cat to hiss or be fearful.</p>
