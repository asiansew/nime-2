<p>Blue eyed cats are more often deaf than white cats with other coloured eyes. White cats, as previously mentioned, can have a wide range of eye colors. Once again, the brilliant scientist was right since between 56% and 90% of cats (according to different studies) with white coat and blue eye color are deaf from one or both ears. I was just asking because my kitten has blue eyes &amp; my friend said that all cats that have blue eyes are deaf. I asked a vet and she said that cats with blue eye could be deaf.</p>

<p>Genes that limit cat coloration result in blue eyes. White cats have always aroused curiosity in humans. When it comes to white cats, they can be deaf no matter the eye color. I think it�s white cats with 2 different colored eyes (like one could be blue, one is another color) that are usually deaf. The easiest way to determine whether or not a cat is an albino is by looking at their eyes.</p>

<p>How do cats get blue eyes? In addition, longhaired white cats are 3 times more likely to be bilaterally deaf. This occurs during fetal development, after conception, the embryo splits into three primitive germ layers: According to the aspca complete guide to cats, 17 to 20 percent of white cats with nonblue eyes are deaf; When it comes to white cats, they can be deaf no matter the eye color.</p>

<p>Losing a cat’s blue eyes is usually the result of too much cataract medication being used, or too many cataract surgeries being performed. My white cat has 2 blue eyes, and he�s not deaf. I think it�s white cats with 2 different colored eyes (like one could be blue, one is another color) that are usually deaf. Deafness is far more common in white cats than in those with other coat colours. This occurs during fetal development, after conception, the embryo splits into three primitive germ layers:</p>
