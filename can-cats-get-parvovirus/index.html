An interesting and frankly somewhat scary report in an upcoming issue of veterinary microbiology (clegg et al 2012) provides further information suggesting that cats might be a source of canine parvovirus infection.this potentially fatal infection, which typically affects young unvaccinated (or inadequately vaccinated) puppies, is a major problem, and outbreaks occur (not uncommonly) in some.
