<p>Of course, a potential owner will want to know the chances of her white cat being deaf. Not all of these cats are deaf (see part 2 of this short article). Well, opinions vary, and so do research conclusions. The deaf ear is usually on the same side as the blue eye. In fact, albino cats usually have light blue eyes and extremely white fur as they have no melanin and therefore no color.</p>

<p>Whilst your cat is white with blue eyes and deaf it is not actually an albino. Eyes may be blue, green or amber, but it is often a combination of one blue and one amber. Felines with a single blue eye are often deaf in one hear (usually the ear on the same side as their blue eye), while two blue eyes make an ivory cat likely to suffer total deafness in both ears. There is a relationship between white cats with blue eyes and genetic deafness, though not all cats with this combination will be affected. Cats with completely white fur often have blue eyes.</p>
