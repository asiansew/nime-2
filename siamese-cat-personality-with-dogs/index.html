<p>While the talkative siamese cat is good with dogs, the owner needs to question the doggo that they have, and it’s temperament. Dogs that are territorial and possessive have a more difficult time adjusting to a new pet—dog or cat—that is equally possessive. Siamese are active, outgoing cats, so as long as your dogs aren�t aggressive, their personality is quite compatible. Scratching posts or the cat trees are known to be the ideal play activity for them. You can also check online stores or local pet supplies for some cat gym products.</p>

<p>The rare flame point siamese cats, by owner accounts, tend to have the best personality traits of the siamese and the red or orange tabby variety of the american shorthair. The body is long, the neck is long, the legs and tail are long. Sometimes, cats tend to meow a lot as a result of behavioral issues. Known there as the vichien mat, it seems to have been a pet for royal and nobility. Siamese are endlessly curious, but inclined to be smart and demanding.</p>
