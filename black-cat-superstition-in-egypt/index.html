<p>The bombay breed is exclusively black. The black cat is often depicted as a symbol of evil, halloween, superstition, and witches. It is believed that the concept of a black cat being lucky originated with ancient egypt. Almost every culture from around the world has their own was of interpreting black cat superstitions. A black cat is a domestic cat with black fur that may be a mixed or specific breed, or a common domestic cat of no particular breed.the cat fanciers� association (cfa) recognizes 22 cat breeds that can come with solid black coats.</p>

<p>As a result, the black cat superstition had found a permanent place in american history, and many people used this a justified excuse for the mistreatment and abuse of black cats. The old belief that a cat has nine lives goes back to ancient egypt. People believed that crossing paths with a black cat was a sign that the devil was watching them and even today, some people fear that their pet cat will suck the breath out of. The black cat is found in many cultures and again has different but similar beliefs or representations, depending on the culture. When cats were eventually domesticated in egypt, people thought black cats were direct descendants of bastet.</p>
