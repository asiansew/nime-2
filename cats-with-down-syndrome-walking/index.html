<p>When they’re still young, cats may not grow and develop properly due to lack of nutrition or genetic condition. People with down syndrome usually have several physical features that set them apart, and certain conditions cats get can mimic these same psychical features. The claim that some cats have down syndrome probably stems from the fact that there are cats born with unusual features, including slanted eyes, like kenny the tiger had, a flat nasal bridge, such as monty’s or a protruding tongue just like lil bub’s. As for down syndrome, cats can have peculiar and unusual physical traits that resemble down syndrome. Down syndrome, also known as trisomy 21, is a genetic condition that affects humans both physically and intellectually.</p>
