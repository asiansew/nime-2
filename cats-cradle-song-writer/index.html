<p>The single topped the us billboard hot 100 in december 1974. Although he recorded a number of hits from 1972 to 1981, chapin is best remembered for “cat’s in the cradle.” the song is actually taken from a poem harry’s wife sandy wrote. As chapin�s only #1 hit song, it became the best known of his work and a staple for folk rock music. He came to the world in the usual way. Whenever i was on a long drive i would listen to country music, because words would keep me awake more than just music.</p>

<p>Alan schwartzberg see all song credits. Cat�s in the cradle is a song about the relationship of a son and his father, not about a woman with a cat. Little boy blue and the man in the moon. He sang a song he�d composed for the occasion. what was the song about? you can find the words over at the historical society, if you�re really interested.. He learned to walk while i was away.</p>
