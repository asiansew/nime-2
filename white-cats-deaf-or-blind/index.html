<p>There is no truth that white cats with blue eyes are blind. Flash the lights or use motion to get your pet&amp;rsquo;s attention when you enter a room to avoid startling them unnecessarily. Of white cats with one blue eye, about 40 percent are deaf in at least one ear. Folks might be mistaking deafness for blindness. The same goes for dalmatians.</p>

<p>3 cats don’t have to be completely white to carry the gene that causes deafness. Some of these cats are deaf in only one ear. Coat color and an aspect of the cat’s personality or another aspect of anatomy can be linked if the gene that dictates the cat’s colour and a gene which affects the way the brain develops are situated close together on the same chromosome. Albino means they lack any pigment causing the white color and in cats blue eyes). There are several steps you can take to make life better for your deaf or hearing impaired pet.</p>

<p>There is no truth that white cats with blue eyes are blind. White cats with blue eyes are at a higher risk. Adult cats usually go deaf due to nerve. 1 the same gene that causes a white coat in cats can also sometimes result in deafness. People might think white cats are more prone to blindness because hereditary deafness is common in white cats.</p>
