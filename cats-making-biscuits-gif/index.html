<p>Post cats doing crazy things! This is a friendly and loving gesture between cat and human, and means your cat is in the mood to be social. Also known as “making biscuits,” cats sometimes make a kneading gesture with their front paws. Nursing kittens knead their mother to stimulate the release of oxytocin, which relaxes the mother and facilitates milk flow. While not all cats knead, it’s a common behavior for young and adult felines alike.</p>
