<p>Now the white around his right eye looks very red. The below remedies will help with eye discharge, eyes that are matted shut, swollen eyes, and other signs of an eye infection in cats. Pollen allergies are not as common as food allergies but as the seasons change, your cat may inhale pollens and suffer from allergic symptoms.

<p>Eye problems can bring out another cat entirely, one who paws at their eyes, squints, or blinks excessively. The last few days i have noticed he is spending more time on the bed rather than playing, though he does play in the morning. They range from allergies to infections, blocked tear ducts, and funny looking eyelids.so grab a box of tissue, dab your eyes, and find. Like humans, cats can be allergic to certain allergens that cause a histamine reaction in the body. If your cat has had weepy eyes for a while, contact your vet for an appointment to have them checked.</p>

<p>Most cats sneeze, if followed with mild symptoms only (such as the watery eyes or runny nose), you can just simply monitor them and have them indoor to be watched for changes. The vet can run an allergy test on your cat to determine if that�s the cause. I noticed his inner eye lids have been showing a lot for the last month. This is one of the most commonly prescribed supplements in shelter medicine and works well for cats with eye issues related to the feline herpes virus. Sometimes that watery discharge is a sign that your cat’s eyes are in full fight mode against a threat to their health.</p>
