<p>The outer horseshoe shaped ring has a temperature of about 3 million degrees celsius. Nebula ini merupakan nebula paling terang di malam hari dengan diameter sudut dua kali lebih besar daripada diameter sudut bulan purnama. Pendant is about an inch in diameter(25mm) and comes with a ~24(~60cm) chain. There are nebulae in other galaxies, just like in our own, but they are usually visible only in the large professional telescopes. The right ascension is the angular distance of an object along the celestial equator from the march equinox.</p>

<p>What is an example of a planetary nebula? Discovered in 1786, the nebula comprises a small but striking core surrounded by a vast, though much fainter, envelope of gas. The full beauty of the cat�s eye nebula (ngc 6543) is revealed in this new, detailed view from nasa�s hubble space telescope. The cat eye nebula, ngc 6543, is a mythical object from the deep sky of the northern hemisphere. Cat�s eye nebula (ngc 6543) with a diameter of 20 seconds of bow, is situated in the north pole of the ecliptic, this very brilliant global nebula, is situated in the constellation of the dragon.this nebula possesses a very vast halo of matter, ejected during its phase of red giant.</p>

<p>I managesd to get some visible by using seceral relatively short exposures, 150s. It was the first planetary nebula whose spectrum was investigated by the english amateur astronomer william huggins, demonstrating that planetary nebulae were gaseous and not stellar in nature. As rough guide, the location is located in the constellation of pisces. The outer horseshoe shaped ring has a temperature of about 3 million degrees celsius. Bernard classified the brightest knot in the nebula in 1900.</p>
