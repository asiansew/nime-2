Worms is a term generally used to describe a parasite manifestation in the digestive tract of a cat. Once your vet determines that your cat has worms, you’ll get a medication for it to take that gets all of the worms out of its system and even helps prevent them from coming back in the near future. Firstly, cats who live outside and hunt are more exposed to getting worms by either eating rodents or chewing on insects or being bitten by ticks and mosquitoes that can carry such parasites. Cats can pick up worms practically everywhere, so it’s surprising when cats get them, especially the ones who rarely or never leave the house.</p>

<p>Thankfully, fleas do not feed on the eggs of all worms, because many worms lay their eggs internally, where the fleas cannot get them. Your cat can pick up a case of worms by sharing a litter box or food and water bowls with an infected cat. A cat may walk through an area with eggs or infected feces, and since cats are often such fastidious groomers, they will then ingest the eggs or fecal particles as they clean their fur and feet. Most infected cats do not show signs of having worms; Heartworm disease in cats, and dogs, is caused by an infestation of the organism dirofilaria immitis, a parasitic nematode (roundworm) commonly referred to as the heartworm.</p>

<p>It is still possible for infection to occur in several ways which are outlined below. These eggs can leach out into the surrounding environment, for example the soil in your garden, where they can survive for long periods of time. Cats usually pick up worms themselves by ingesting the feces of other infected cats. Reviewed and updated for accuracy on july 8, 2019 by dr. I feel the best way to remember these different types is to describe them visually or from how they affect your cat.</p>

<p>I feel the best way to remember these different types is to describe them visually or from how they affect your cat. From a human’s clothes or body. On most occasions, your cat can’t get rid of them by herself, and she’ll need medication. Your cat can pick up a case of worms by sharing a litter box or food and water bowls with an infected cat. Kittens often pick up worms from the mother in her milk, while adult cats pick up worms by accidentally eating worm eggs or eating vermin infested with worms.</p>
