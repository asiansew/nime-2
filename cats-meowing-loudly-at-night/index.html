<p>By crying loudly, a stray cat is effectively communicating to you that she needs your help and attention immediately. There are a number of reasons why your bengal may be meowing during the night. This can be disorienting for them and they may express their anxiety and frustration with excessive meowing. This common feline behaviour can occur because of a cat’s natural instincts, because of other factors at play, or both. Cats also yowl—a sound similar to the meow but more drawn out and melodic.</p>

<p>If your cat is verbalizing excessively after dark, something is wrong. Your cat’s meowing at night may have much to do with the fact that they are naturally more active at certain hours of the night. No, this article is about geriatric cats yowling or screaming — these cats sound genuinely distressed.they may walk aimlessly, not trying to communicate with you — just vocalizing. When older cats begin to lose their hearing, they often meow loudly at night in order to hear themselves, similarly to when an elderly person starts to lose their hearing, they begin talking louder. Cats are naturally more active at night.</p>
