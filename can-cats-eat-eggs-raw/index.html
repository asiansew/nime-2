The risk of bacteria like this is actually quite low, and they would need to eat a lot of egg whites for the avidin thing to become a serious problem. Cats can be fed fresh meat as part of a balanced diet, which is thoroughly cooked through and with all bones removed to prevent obstruction of the digestive system or from damaging their teeth.</p>

<p>It not only disrupts biotin absorption but also affects the chemical processes of energy, amino acids, glucose and fats. There is a multitude of illnesses that can be caused by raw or undercooked eggs. Cooking will denature the avidin. Obviously, cats also need many vitamins and proteins for their daily living, however, you should avoid feeding your cat raw eggs, as this causes the appearance of parasites that can make you sick, and, also, raw eggs expose your cat to salmonella and more diseases. However, it’s better to be safe than sorry.</p>

<p>Eggs are good sources of protein and fat, and cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they eat a diet of mostly animal protein. If the answer to “can cats eat eggs?” is yes, why must they eat them in moderation? How should eggs for cats be prepared? If cats eat raw eggs, similar to humans, they are also at risk of contracting bacteria like salmonella, which can make them unwell. So can cats eat eggs?</p>
