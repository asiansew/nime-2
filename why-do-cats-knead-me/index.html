<p>A nursing kitten instinctually kneads to help stimulate the mother’s milk production. Kneading may have an origin going back to cats� wild ancestors who had to tread down grass or foliage to make a temporary nest in which to rest. Kittens who are weaned too early may not only knead, but also attempt to suckle on human skin, earlobes, stuffed toys and even the family dog. Massaging is an instinctive behavior practiced by many cats throughout their lives, but usually begins in kittens shortly after birth. Kneading is the back and forth motion a cat makes by alternating its paws against something soft.</p>
