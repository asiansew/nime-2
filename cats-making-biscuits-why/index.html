<p>If you have a cat, it’s no doubt that you have heard some of these cute slang terms for cat kneading. In kittenhood, kneading stimulates the mother cat’s milk while nursing. Kneading (also referred to as making biscuits or the cha cha) is an activity common to all domestic cats whereby, when in a state of ease, they alternately push out and pull in their front paws, often alternating between right and left limbs. Many cats are known to vomit up their dry food after eating. Nobody knows much about why cats do anything.</p>

<p>Making biscuits, working the dough, happy paws, mashing potatoes. I call it eye gouging. It’s like an organic laser pointer or chasing after a piece of string. Many adult cats knead, which is when a cat works their paws back and forth on soft objects like blankets, their cat beds, and even their human There are many notions but few dependable facts.</p>

<p>Cats often perform this motion — sometimes called kneading dough or making biscuits — on soft surfaces, including pillows, blankets, other animals and even people. It can be quite comical to watch. Nobody knows much about why cats do anything. Whatever you may call it, the adorable and somewhat baffling cat behavior of kneading often leaves many cat owners scratching their heads. So wise and so focused.</p>
