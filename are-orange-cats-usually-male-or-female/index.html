<p>Orange tabby cats are about 80/20 male to female. All a female would need is the gene for orange and not have a gene for black, therefore producing an orange cat right? And it’s not some sort of magic — it’s genetics. The gene that codes for orange fur is on the x chromosome. One of the common myths about orange tabby cats is that they are all male.</p>

<p>All orange tabby cats are male (myth) orange tabby cats are some of the most recognized of the bunch. The red gene may be the o variant, producing red pigment, or the o variant that does not. Although orange tabby cats are primarily male, female orange tabbies do exist in a ratio of about 80 percent male to 20 percent female, according to arnold plotnick, dvm. Females have two x chromosomes and so need two copies of this gene to become ginger. Ginger cats are more likely to be male than female.</p>
