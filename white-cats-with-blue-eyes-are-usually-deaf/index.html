<p>Unless both ears are affected, cats may never show any signs of hearing loss. Blue eyed cats are more often deaf than white cats with other coloured eyes. Deafness is far more common in white cats than in those with other coat colours. Still, look at it this way: If 40 percent of these cats are deaf, it means the majority (60 percent) can hear.</p>

<p>Eye color in white cats also relates to the potential for deafness. According to the aspca complete guide to cats, 17 to 20 percent of white cats with nonblue eyes are deaf; White cats have always aroused curiosity in humans. This occurs during fetal development, after conception, the embryo splits into three primitive germ layers: But if the white cat has any other color of eyes, or if it has one blue eye and one eye that is not blue, then they usually are not deaf.</p>

<p>You can help a deaf cat lead a happy, full life by keeping it protected indoors and learning to use visual signals and vibrations to communicate. And, if the white cat has a different eye color for each eye (heterochromia. White cats have always aroused curiosity in humans. I was just asking because my kitten has blue eyes &amp; my friend said that all cats that have blue eyes are deaf. Felines with a single blue eye are often deaf in one hear (usually the ear on the same side as their blue eye), while two blue eyes make an ivory cat likely to suffer total deafness in both ears.</p>

<p>Hereditary deafness is a major concern in white cats, and even more so if one or both irises are blue in color. It is a congenital deafness caused by a degeneration of the inner ear. While this could be true to some extent, it doesnât make black and white cats that much different from other cats of the same breed. The easiest way to determine whether or not a cat is an albino is by looking at their eyes. White cats with blue eyes are deaf, not blind.</p>
