<p>To summarize the answer, in short, if your cat likes to eat some pieces of strawberries then it’s fine. Strawberry is a fruit has bright red colour and juicy sweetness and has some nice texture. Your cat may also vomit, as its digestion is not accustomed to acids found in strawberries. With this in mind, cats can eat strawberries. Commercial strawberry jams may contain large amounts of sugar.</p>
