Youthful cats are more susceptible to having dilated pupils as a result of elation than much older cats and calmer cats. I have an older female cat that just showed up at my house one day last fall.</p>

<p>When unequal pupils occur, the abnormal eye can be either the smaller (constricted) pupil or the larger (dilated) pupil. It can be a sign of a physical ailment or disease if it�s a constant condition, such as hypertension, anisocoria, or dysautonomia. Strokes in cats are not always as devastating to the animal as strokes tend to be in humans; Nystagmus can occur in both dogs and cats and is a characteristic sign of a problem in the animal�s nervous system. Meaning, the eyes unintentionally move or swing back and forth.</p>

<p>Meaning, the eyes unintentionally move or swing back and forth. I never see them with slits and they appear dull. My cat�s eyes appear to have become more dilated slowly over the last 6 months. The first thing we spotted was unresponsive pupils. If your cat’s eyes are wetter than usual, if it’s blinking a lot, or if there are often tear tracks on the fur around their eyes, that could be a sign that their eyes are watering.</p>
