Male orange tabby cats outnumber females approximately 4 to 1. A male cat needs only one orange gene, which he gets from his mother (orange, calico, or tortoiseshell). Abyssinians are favored for the orange ticked pattern.</p>

<p>The female cat, therefore, can have the orange mutant gene on one x chromosome and the gene for a black coat on the other. Most orange cats happen to be male, but that doesn�t mean there aren�t still female orange tabbies out there! To have black and orange in the same cat, the cat needs two x chromosomes. Cat lovers generally believe that orange cats tend to be the most affectionate. Cats come in a wide range of colors, from plain black or white to gray, brown and orange.</p>

<p>An orange kitten is unique on its own. The color of a cat’s coat is closely linked to its gender. That’s why orange cats are usually male. This orange gene can appear in calico cats and tortoiseshells too. *this is because the “ginger gene” which produces the orange color is on the x chromosome.</p>
