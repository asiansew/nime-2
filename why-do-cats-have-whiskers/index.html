The word ‘whisker’ itself arises from a latin word ‘vibrio’ meaning ‘vibrate’. When air moves over the whiskers, they vibrate, which stimulates the nerves,” explains lana. The hair follicle of your cat’s whiskers is loaded with nerves, and the whisker tip features a sensory organ known as a proprioceptor.</p>
