<p>The lykoi cat is an unusual breed that was developed from a naturally occurring mutation found among some feral cats.the mutation gives the cat the appearance of a werewolf. the name lykoi means wolf in greek. Trip to the vet said 10oz, 5 weeks old and a male. It is rare in adults or older kittens to be all red (orange) with any shade of blue eyes. Red tabbies with blue eyes as an adult cat are pretty rare. Yellow with big blue eyes.</p>

<p>Came home one day to find an adorable, tiny kitten in my driveway. White cat with blue eyes. Cats can have eyes of very varied colors and of varying intensity emerald green, copper orange, yellow amber etc. Brown eyes, orange eyes and sort of blue eyes. Cream can show up in any number of patterns, such as a full cream colored tabby cat to a cream colored pointed cat.</p>

<p>They have gone on to produce litters with a variety of markings, and they have perhaps the deepest blue eyes seen in any breed of cat. The orange fur is determined by a gene located on the x chromosome. But if you have a red tabby kitten they may keep the blue eyes for about 2 months before they start changing to the adult color of green to gold, or a mix of both colors. The other 4 cats are burmese, two have what’s called milk chocolate coats, like the siamese dark points at ears, nose, paws and tail, both have yellow eyes one a boy the other a girl. While pedigreed black cats have a tendency towards bold orange eyes and white cats tend to have blue eyes, there�s very little to connect coat color with eye color.</p>
