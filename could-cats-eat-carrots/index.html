<p>Even better, carrots don’t contain anything that could be harmful to cats, even if they eat more than one. Carrots are perfectly safe for cats to eat. A case study in comparative clinical pathology discusses a case of onion toxicities in sheep. Of the flock, 2 animals died, 4 miscarried, and 12 more. Whether they should or not will depend on their personal preferences for it, and is ultimately up to you as an owner.</p>

<p>While they aren’t a normal part of your cat�s diet, they are something that your cat could eat if they show interest and you are okay with. Cats and dogs are not grain. Some people use celery on the skin to repel mosquitos. Both vegetables are safe and good with nutrition. In fact, most of the croquettes that you buy at the supermarket also contain carrots, but like other vegetables, apart from the typical meat content.</p>
