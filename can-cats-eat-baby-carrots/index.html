If you are willing to carefully control portion sizes and monitor all of the other vegetables that you are offering in the diet, then carrots can look to be fed. In fact, many cats love carrots. There are also some specially made cat treats that can be great if you want to introduce fruits and vegetables in your cat’s diet. Last updated on july 25, 2019.</p>

<p>I would not give a dog more than half a stick of carrot a day for more than 3 days a week. The answer is yes, cats can eat certain types of baby food in moderation. As is true for most vegetables, however, carrots should be cooked before feeding them to your cat. The same rules can apply to cats and particularly with chicken soup, you can continue to flood many important nutrients to their stomach whilst calming it at the same time. When it comes to whether cats can eat corn, the effects are a bit less noticeable.</p>

<p>Introducing that much oil and sugar into a puppy’s diet is a fast track to an upset stomach. Fat cats are no joke, and we know responsible pet owners like you are doing all you can to help keep your cat as healthy as he can be. But as always, you must ask your vet before sharing any human foods with your cat, including carrots. Carrots while cats, unlike humans, don’t require veggies in their diet, they can be a safe and healthy treat. Observe them carefully over the next several days for any change in behavior, specifically more frequent scratching of the skin.</p>
