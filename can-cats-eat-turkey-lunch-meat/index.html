<p>According to the american dietetic association, once you open a package of lunch meat, it�s safe to eat it for about five days. Food allergies, namely turkey allergies, are common in cats. Make sure not to feed them raw or spoiled meats. Turkeys can be wild or domesticated, similar to other birds like chickens and ducks, which impacts the type and quality of meat. Give your kitty some cooked beef, chicken, turkey, even deli meats from your local grocery store.</p>
