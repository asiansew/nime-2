<p>Both of my dogs just love them &amp; have shown no adverse effects in the last 3 yrs. And can dogs eat pork bones or pork rib bones? Pork rinds are the fried skin of pork and most of the cats like them. We sit and eat them together. The sanskrit name of the cat pose, marjaiasana, comes from marjay meaning cat and asana meaning posture.</p>

<p>If your pork rinds begin to smell rancid, don’t eat them. This cat loves peanuts and pork rinds a diet like this is not for the weak of heart, or stomach. Other causes of pork allergy are unknown. But, they should only eat it in moderation and if you want to be overly cautious about your cat’s diet, just don’t give them any. I have one dog that is allergic to corn &amp; wheat plus she has inflammatory bowel disease.</p>
