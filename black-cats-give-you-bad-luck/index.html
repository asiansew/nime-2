<p>Of course, the association between black cats and evil or bad luck is nothing more than a superstition. Is being superstitious a thing of the past, though? However, black cats weren’t always the face of bad luck. This fear of black cats appears to stem from medieval times when an animal with dark feathers or fur, including crows and ravens, signaled death. For one thing, superstitions give some people a sense of control.</p>

<p>I was taught that if a black cat crosses your path to the left, it it good luck, and if it crosses to your right, it is a sign of bad luck or troubles to come. Making the world a better place for dogs. Unlike much of the western world, japanese culture sees a black cat crossing your path as a good omen. Even today many people think black cats bring bad luck. Ok black cats are thought to bring bad luck—but essentially they’re absolutely adorable.</p>

<p>The irish believe a black cat on your porch means good luck, in japan black cats, are revered as symbols of prosperity and in britain black cat passing your path brings you good luck. Do black cats give you bad luck and do i have bad luck now? Whenever i think of superstition, the “bad luck” (and hardcore creepiness) black cats and friday the 13th supposedly bring first come to mind. Black cats are bad pets. I won’t walk under a ladder.</p>
