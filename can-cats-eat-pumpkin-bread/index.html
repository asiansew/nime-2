Just plain, boiled or baked, pureed pumpkin for your little fluff ball. Pumpkin is safe and even healthy for cats to consume. The nutritional benefits of bananas have been well documented and this includes improved digestion, as well as increased energy.</p>

<p>Cats are notorious obligate carnivores, which contrary to popular opinion, does not mean that cats will not (or cannot) eat vegetables. Some foods that veterinarians often recommend that cats avoid—such as cheese—can be useful for giving cats pills. But put your pumpkin spice latte out of reach, please. Dogs can safely eat pumpkin with no problems, provided that it is cooked, raw, or canned organic and natural pumpkin and that it is slowly introduced into the dog’s regular diet. Just plain, boiled or baked, pureed pumpkin for your little fluff ball.</p>
