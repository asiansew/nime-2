<p>On the surface, this behavior might make it seem like your cat is being hot and cold. It�s never quite explained what that means, or how it translates into them disliking geralt/witchers. Your cat might be fearful of his new surroundings if you just adopted him. It’s more likely that your cat is upset because of the new cat entering the home and they are in a mood. If you are a cat owner and decide to introduce a new kitten to your household, you are almost certainly hoping your cat will take to the change well and that the two will become friends.</p>

<p>Your reaction may be to approach or reprove the cat, but his hissing action should override your impulse. Why do cats hiss at new kittens? Growling and hissing are both very common ways that cats communicate. The list of things that cats see as dangerous is a long one: Whatever the case, be sure your cat has a few hiding places to retreat to until he feels safe enough to come out.</p>

<p>You can’t stop your cat from hissing, however you can do any number of things to help the cat feel less threatened. Don’t take this personally, in my experience it’s really not the case. As it is the case with practically any strange cat behavior, the reasons why cats hiss can be numerous. “if they come up to you and they rub up against you, they may simply be just greeting you,” said dr. Cats hiss to let you know something has made them unhappy.</p>
