<p>Cat eyes could remain dilated throughout a day and night for medical or psychological reasons. They give the cat the ability to see in very low levels of light and then there is the way that the eyes gleam when light is shined onto them. However, feline hair loss can also be genetic or due to fungal infections, mites, fleas, and stress. A cat with constantly dilated eyes is a source of concern. The blue eye colour is linked to the coat, which is the siamese pattern or colourpoint. Cat eyes and hypertension hypertension, commonly referred to as high blood pressure, is a very common physiological culprit of dilated pupils.</p>
<h3 id="i-am-wondering-why-her-pupils-are-dilated-in-light-as-well-as-dark-conditions">I am wondering why her pupils are dilated in light as well as dark conditions.</h3><p>They open and close much faster than a round pupil, which allows for much more light to enter the eyes. I always have loved her eyes,shes the only cat i have with greenish eyes and the other night i was sitting playing my xbox with my lamp only on and i looked at her and 1 eye looks normal color and the other is a bright yellow/green like it looks like one eye is a flash light. I have not called the vet yet. If unequal pupils occur suddenly, bring your cat to a veterinary clinic or animal hospital immediately as eyesight can be permanently damaged if the problem is not rectified. Either because their pupils are always somewhat wider or because their pupils, once dilated, are slow to. I took her to an ophthalmologist for pets, which was surprisingly inexpensive, and they examined her eyes.</p>

<p>You might also notice very dilated pupils as your cat’s eyes try to get more light into the back of the eye. My cat (8mos) is part siamese and was a stray. I would most definitely get it checked out. I rescued my cat luna about a year and a half ago from a family friend. Sometimes dilated pupils can be a signal that something�s not quite right.</p>

<p>Night vision tends to be lost first. He was very scared and nervous and it took about a month before he�d let us touch him. I always have loved her eyes,shes the only cat i have with greenish eyes and the other night i was sitting playing my xbox with my lamp only on and i looked at her and 1 eye looks normal color and the other is a bright yellow/green like it looks like one eye is a flash light.

<p>Now, back to my point. And they look kind of blue around the outside of the pupil. Some cats have visible balding around the eyes, while others have a slight thinning of the fur above the eyes, but you need to know why. Cat owners always tend to be extremely close with their pets and there is always a lot of affection shown by both the owner and the cat, so you are always likely to notice any. During the day i have noticed his eyes are always dilated.</p>
