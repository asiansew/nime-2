<p><strong>White Cats Deafness Blue Eyes</strong>. Albino cats (red eyes due to c gene or blue due to k gene) totally or partially white cats (due to the s gene) all white cats (due to the dominant w gene) we find in the last group, those that are white due to the dominant gene w. White cats need to inherit a particular gene or gene complex to be diagnosed deaf. However, things are not quite that simple and clear cut. Eye color in white cats also relates to the potential for deafness.</p>

<p>Cats that have the dominant white gene can sometimes, but not always, have blue eyes. 1 the same gene that causes a white coat in cats can also sometimes result in deafness. It�s believed that the ear closest to the oddly colored eye (or both ears if both eyes are uniquely colored) will be the ear with deafness. The prevalence of deafness is high in cat populations in which the dominant white gene is segregating. 3 cats don’t have to be completely white to carry the gene that causes deafness. There is a developmental fault in the ectoderm which results in deafness.</p>
<h3 id="studies-have-shown-that-solid-white-cats-with-two-blue-eyes-have-65-to-85-chance-of-being-deaf">Studies have shown that solid white cats with two blue eyes have 65% to 85% chance of being deaf.</h3><p>Domesticated cats with blue eyes and white coats are often completely deaf. In one 1997 study of white cats, 72% of the animals were found to be totally deaf. The prevalence of deafness is high in cat populations in which the dominant white gene is segregating. However, there is no need to be feared to bring a cat with blue eyes home because more than 50 percents of cats who are not pure white, their blue eyes are not always related to deafness and blindness. Hereditary deafness is a major concern in white cats, and even more so if one or both irises are blue in color. There is a gene/gene complex which causes white coat, blue eyes and deafness, but not all cats get their white coat and blue eyes from that particular gene, so not all white cats will be deaf.</p>

<p>The objective of this study was to investigate whether there is a gene that is responsible for deafness as well as for blue eyes and to establish a plausible mode of inheritance. There are other reasons for cats being white, and also other genes which can affect eye colour. It is a congenital deafness caused by a degeneration of the inner ear. The objective of this study was to investigate whether there is a gene that is responsible for deafness as well as for blue eyes and to establish a plausible mode of inheritance. And 65 to 85 percent of white cats with two blue eyes were deaf.</p>

<p>So if the cat has blue eyes, it is more likely to be deaf, and if it has only one blue eye, it maybe deaf on only that side, and the cochlea in the ear on the other side will have developed normally. In addition, cats with albinism are susceptible to suffering from both deafness and blindness. The chance of deafness is as high as 80% in a white cat with 2 blue eyes. 40 percent of white cats with one blue eye were deaf; 40% chance of hearing loss if a cat has only one blue eye.</p>

<p>Indeed, says james flanders, dvm, associate professor of surgery at cornell university’s college of veterinary medicine, “about 80 percent of white. If this is not treated early, cats will not be able to hear as well as they should be able to. Meantime, the same defect often also affects a cell layer of the inner ear that is essential for hearing. Eye color in white cats also relates to the potential for deafness. Cats with blue eyes can sometimes have visual or auditory deficiencies.</p>

<p>The chance of deafness is as high as 80% in a white cat with 2 blue eyes. The chance of deafness is as high as 80% in a white cat with 2 blue eyes. 65% to 85% deafness occurs if a white cat’s eyes are both blue. Some of these breeds only ever have. Deafness can occur in white cats with yellow, green or blue irises, although it is mostly likely in white cats with blue irises.</p>

<p>1 the same gene that causes a white coat in cats can also sometimes result in deafness. If a cat with odd eyes is deaf, it is always on the same side as the blue eye. 65% to 85% deafness occurs if a white cat’s eyes are both blue. Cats that have the dominant white gene can sometimes, but not always, have blue eyes. Pointed cats, like siamese, who have a lighter body and darker extremities, always have blue eyes.</p>

<p>When the white spot gene affects both eyes the cat will have blue eyes. The white fur and blue eyes both are a consequence of a lack of melanin from pigment cells. If a white cat has only one blue eye, there’s about 40% chance of hearing loss. If this is not treated early, cats will not be able to hear as well as they should be able to. There is a developmental fault in the ectoderm which results in deafness.</p>

<p>From what i read, pure white cats, specially with blue eyes are very likely to be deaf, amost 80%. Deafness is more likely to occur in white cats with blue eyes; There is a gene/gene complex which causes white coat, blue eyes and deafness, but not all cats get their white coat and blue eyes from that particular gene, so not all white cats will be deaf. However, that is not guaranteed. Some cats are born deaf, and the disability cannot be corrected.</p>

<p>It�s believed that the ear closest to the oddly colored eye (or both ears if both eyes are uniquely colored) will be the ear with deafness. Many cats are born with congenital deafness, which causes deafness in the cat as it ages, instead of later on. Cats can be deaf in one or both ears. Some cats are born deaf, and the disability cannot be corrected. However, the prevalence of white cats does vary in different geographies.</p>

<p>Domesticated cats with blue eyes and white coats are often completely deaf. Congenital sensorineural deafness occurs in domestic cats with a white coat. Many cats are born with congenital deafness, which causes deafness in the cat as it ages, instead of later on. Albino cats (red eyes due to c gene or blue due to k gene) totally or partially white cats (due to the s gene) all white cats (due to the dominant w gene) we find in the last group, those that are white due to the dominant gene w. White cats are also genetically more predisposed to being deaf.</p>

<p>Albino cats are also incredibly sensitive to prolonged and intense sun exposure. Congenital sensorineural deafness occurs in domestic cats with a white coat. If a white cat has only one blue eye, there’s about 40% chance of hearing loss. 65% to 85% deafness occurs if a white cat’s eyes are both blue. Indeed, says james flanders, dvm, associate professor of surgery at cornell university’s college of veterinary medicine, “about 80 percent of white.</p>

<p>Pointed cats, like siamese, who have a lighter body and darker extremities, always have blue eyes. The vet saw them with about 3 weeks, they are now about 4. The main characteristic of an albino cat is a complete unblemished white coat, blue eyes and pink skin, including the nose, eyelids, ears and paw pads. 2 cats with white coats and blue eyes are highly likely to be deaf in one or both ears. However, things are not quite that simple and clear cut.</p>

<p>There are other reasons for cats being white, and also other genes which can affect eye colour. If this is not treated early, cats will not be able to hear as well as they should be able to. It is a congenital deafness caused by a degeneration of the inner ear. If a white cat has only one blue eye, there’s about 40% chance of hearing loss. In addition, cats with albinism are susceptible to suffering from both deafness and blindness.</p>
