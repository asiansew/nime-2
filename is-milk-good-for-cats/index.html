<p>For cats capable of digesting milk, we need to be careful about keeping them trim; How often can i give milk to my cat? That’s why you shouldn’t use milk as a replacement for your cat’s meal.

As you know, i really don’t recommend doing this due to all the reasons that i talked about above.</p>

<p>Experts say that if a cat consumes cow’s milk alone, he will not be supplied with essential nutrients needed in order to support his overall health. Milk doesn�t part of necessary cat nutrition and many cats suffer stomach upsets or other related problems because their owner thought that they were giving them a treat. While veterinarians agree that milk is not a full meal and should be given as a treat only, there�s no consensus on how much milk is safe for cats. Some say that cats lack the ability to process lactose and are therefore intolerant to milk products. “we generally recommend that cats be fed no more than 20 to 30 calories a day from unbalanced sources, such as human food.</p>

<p>Even though cats love to drink milk from their mothers, studies have shown that dairy products, like milk, can cause diarrhea to some cats. If you’re feeding your cat human food or commercial treat, let it not exceed. Just serve a bowl of cereal and leave it at your fingertips. The truth is that few cats actually have it and the majority of cats don’t produce enough of it so as to avoid developing indigestion. I’m sure there are many more reasons too.</p>
