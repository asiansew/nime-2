Researchers cannot say for sure why cats develop it, but other medical issues can lead to kidney disease, such as an infection, a virus, gum disease, and dehydration. In the initial stages of kidney failure, the kidneys cope with their inability to efficiently remove waste products by excreting them at a lower concentration over a larger volume (in other words, by producing a larger amount of more dilute urine). There are two types of kidney failure in cats. This is persistent and happens slowly over time.</p>
