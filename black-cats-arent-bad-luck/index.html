<p>In the 19 th century sailors kept black cats on ships as they believed it would bring them luck. Black cats aren�t the cause of bad luck. Your mini panther may be a small girl or she may have a cute, little kitten face. Black is also tied to funerals and if a black cat crossed your path it meant bad luck or early death. A black lucky cat not only brings luck but also frightens away demons, evil energy, and stalkers.</p>

<p>A black lucky cat not only brings luck but also frightens away demons, evil energy, and stalkers. That�s bad luck! and my stepdad�s answer was only if you�re prey and immediately got his foot caught on her and landed in the wet grass. Black cats are universally known as witch pets that bring bad luck. If a black cat crosses the path from right to left then it is a bad omen as with the most other countries in europe.
