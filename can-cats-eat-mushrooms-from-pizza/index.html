<p>No, dogs can�t eat mushrooms. Is it safe for cats to eat salami? But mushrooms deserve to be tossed into your shopping cart and added to meals a lot more often (not just ordered on pizza, though that’s yummy too!). Onions, garlic, shallots, and scallions can cause damage to your cat. Usually chickens don’t second guess what they are eating.</p>

<p>But dogs and cats don’t metabolize foods the same way we do, and many of the foods we eat without problems can hurt, and even kill them. This means that they cant eat them at all. While the kinds we find at the grocer are not poisonous to cats, many wild species of mushrooms can be. So, while you may feel free to enjoy mushrooms on your pizza, in your pasta, or as a side dish swimming in garlic butter, your beloved pet rabbit need not feel left out. Cats love green olives( would you believe that)?</p>
