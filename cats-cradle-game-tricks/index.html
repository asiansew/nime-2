<p>How to do the hammock string figure this is my most popular video of all. See what shows we have coming up at cat�s cradle, cat�s cradle back room, and other venues around the triangle. Cat�s cradle is a string game that can be played in a series of steps, between two people or individually, with the objective being to create images with the string. Cat�s cradle is a string game you may remember from childhood. If you don’t have a friend to play this game with, i have a video of a solo version of cat’s cradle that makes all the same shapes, but you don’t have to pass it back and forth.</p>
