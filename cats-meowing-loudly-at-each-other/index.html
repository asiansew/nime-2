<p>Purring does not always mean that the cat is happy; This can be loud and is known as caterwauling. Living outdoors also leads to many dangerous and unpredictable situations for stray cats, from being run over by rapidly speeding cars to nonstop violent altercations with other animals (especially when it comes to tomcats). Interestingly, adult cats don�t usually meow at each other. Some cats purr loudly when they are scared or offended.</p>

<p>We know that cats are capable of making a huge variety of noises. Some cats purr loudly when they are scared or offended. Other male cats too and this is why litters can contain kittens with different fathers and so look very different from each other. Usually when cats meow loudly at each other, they are having an argument about food or territory. The developed language wonderfully meets the needs of communication with relatives and people.</p>
