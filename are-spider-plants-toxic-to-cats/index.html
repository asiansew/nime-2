<p>According to the aspca, spider plants are not poisonous to cats. However, some of the compounds are similar to those in opioids, so eating too much can result in vomiting or diarrhea. Are spider plants poisonous for cats and dogs? Spider plants are not toxic to dogs, but can make them sick if eaten frequently. Chlorophytum comosum, airplane plants, or snake plantsare safe for cats and other pets, i.e., they are not toxic or poisonous to not just your cats but also dogs and horses.</p>

<p>However, cats and dogs do love the taste of the spider plant, and sometimes they will eat enough to make them sick. One of my cats doesn’t react to catnip but does show interest in valerian. So, spider plants aren’t toxic per se, but they can lead to these unpleasant effects later. According to the aspca and other educational websites, spider plants are not toxic to cats (or dogs.) however, because cats are drawn to spider plants for the chemical compounds, they may get an upset stomach if they eat the leaves. The hallucinogenic effect of the spider plant or any other actual effect from any other thing can’t be considered harmful which is what aspca says.</p>

<p>The hallucinogenic effect is not that harmful to cats. Thank you, spider plant (chlorophytum), for looking just as cool today as you did in grandma�s kitchen in 1978. If you do see your dog eating a spider plant and then being sick, that doesn’t mean they are having a toxic and poisonous reaction. Houseplants are a common sight in nearly every home. Ingestion causes irritation of the mouth and lips, and hypersalivation.</p>
