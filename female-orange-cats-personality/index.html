There are anecdotal reports that cat owners view ginger cats as friendly, with a survey run by uc davis which found people were more likely to assign positive personality traits to orange cats and interestingly, less positive personality traits to tortoiseshell cats. This is because the gene that causes a cat to be orange is linked to sex, and statistically most orange cats are boys.</p>

<p>Several liked to play with dogs, too. This is thanks to the fact that they are animals with a mysterious character and a very special personality. Unlike other shy cats, these orange cats appear more comfortable in approaching humans. One of the most obvious myths is that black cats bring bad luck. Although orange tabby cats are primarily male, female orange tabbies do exist in a ratio of about 80 percent male to 20 percent female, according to arnold plotnick, dvm.</p>

<p>This is because the gene that causes a cat to be orange is linked to sex, and statistically most orange cats are boys. This means that there are more male cats with orange fur than female cats. If it can still happen that a male is born with a tortoiseshell or turtle coat, this occurs only 1 time out of 3,000. Only about two out of 10 orange cats are female, so if you have an orange girl cat, consider yourself blessed with an extra special pet! Male cats with their xy chromosomes only need one copy of the gene.</p>
