A few effective flea repellents are rosemary oil and cedarwood oil, if diluted or diffused properly. However, garlic is toxic to cats, so it should never be included in their diet. You have to ensure that you confirm from the list below and run a quick web search if you’re unsure about any essential oil or its contents. These foods are typically poisonous to cats.</p>

<p>If you are giving your olive oils keep the amount no more than 1 teaspoon. Some cat owners give their cats garlic because it is believed to have medicinal benefits, including the prevention of heart disease and fleas. A chemical eugenol may have a long term affect. Onions, garlic, shallots, and scallions can cause damage to your cat. However, there is some debate as to whether garlic is a safe food or health supplement for cats or pets in general.</p>

<p>If you want to be on the safe side, however, you could make up a new batch of garlic oil once a week or so. For balancing, calming and relaxing your cat, lavender or valerian are ok to use. Animals often like to have their ears massaged anyway, especially when they’re having trouble with them. Aspca does not list them and they have the largest pet poison listings. You probably won�t have to worry about it, since most dogs and cats have a fairly high resistance to botulism.</p>

<p>Have heard this for dogs and cats but i dont know the truth of it. That can also be toxic. Clove oil is going to be much more concentrated than ground clove. The biggest concern of feeding olive oil for cats is overdose, which can cause severe diarrhea. Cats can eat olives in small amounts.</p>
