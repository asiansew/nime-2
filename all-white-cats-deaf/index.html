<p>Veterinerman / instagram the same genetic factors that give white cats their snowy coats and unique eye colors can also cause total or partial deafness in many kitties. When we discover that a cat is deaf, or if we are considering adopting a deaf cat, it is important to sort through the misinformation to learn how to best live with a deaf feline companion. There is a relationship between white cats with blue eyes and genetic deafness, though not all cats with this combination will be affected.
