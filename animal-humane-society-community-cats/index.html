(they’re often referred to as feral cats, stray cats, or outdoor cats, as well.) this is usually because they have not been socialized to humans and prefer to keep their distance from people. Animal control resources are able to focus on animals in immediate danger or need, not diverted to collecting healthy cats. The colony occupies and defends a specific territory where food (a restaurant dumpster or a person who feeds them) and shelter (beneath a porch, in an abandoned building, etc.) are available.</p>
