Spiderleg is overall a loyal warrior, but shares his sharp tongue with his father, dustpelt, and is often one of the key characters to protest against something unusual. A pale gray robust tomcat with dark blue eyes who was a warrior. Cats have no romantic relationships or lifetime mates to begin with, and there�s plenty of other stuff in warriors that is far from reality.</p>

<p>Original artwork take this quiz! Please add character tropes exclusive to dawn of the clans to the dawn of the clans character page, not here. I was quite a looker: Representation is important for the community and warriors would be a great series for it since it reaches a wide audience of a range of ages, and there is a large portion of the fanbase that are lgbt. This category lists every character that has been mentioned throughout the warriors series.</p>
