Best horror film of the year! being back in my hometown for the holidays (which has like, one bar, by the way) has led me to a new favorite hobby: Cgi cats would be way better, than some knock off will smith, and jack black, like common now. The cats movie reviews are in, and folks, they are…not great. It�s essentially about a bunch of felines — called jellicle cats.</p>

<p>Cgi cats would be way better, than some knock off will smith, and jack black, like common now. We can trust stephen colbert to always deliver a laugh. Cats hits cinemas today, and the majority of reviews for the movie are extremely negative. I’ve never been more profoundly, alarmingly, curiously and viscerally aware of genitalia. Joe said that he started the humorous account purely by accident.</p>

<p>Insider rounded up 50 of the funniest, most searing movie reviews ever written. Other reviews are useless, like the ones where people give something a one star just because it arrived late. Review embargo just lifted for cats. Some of these reviews are legit worst of the year contenders. Reddit consists of thousands of subreddits, which are pages devoted to individual topics.</p>

<p>But there�s another type of review that�s neither useful nor useless, but what they lack in helpfulness, they make up for in pure hilarity. Find communities you�re interested in, and become part of an online community! Going to the dogs lacking a story and filled with forgettable music, the film is an artistic hairball. Lots of savage (and hilarious) 1/10 or 2/10 reviews. Watch “there’s a reason cats rule the internet.</p>
