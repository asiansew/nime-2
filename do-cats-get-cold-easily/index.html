This will not be enough to place a cat in any danger, though. Like kids in daycare, kittens in pet stores or shelters are more likely to develop upper respiratory. But this doesn’t mean it can keep your cat warm in the winter. If in doubt, give your vet a shout.</p>

<p>Do you find yourself shivering when no one else is? Keeping cats out of severe weather is an easy way to prevent these problems from occurring. Senior cats have a compromised ability to keep their body temperatures from falling below normal, and should be kept indoors in warm, heated temperatures to prevent illness. We must provide them with extra protection against the cold. Of course, a comfy bed isn’t the only way to make your older pet comfortable.</p>

<p>Kittens or young cats do not have entirely developed immune systems. Either from illness, or from extreme temperatures. While my husband and i can easily throw on an extra pair of socks or a sweater, our cats aren’t nearly as lucky. The first thing to know is that, in cold temperatures your cat will actually feel colder.although these animals prepare for winter by changing their fur, some breeds do have shorter and less dense coats (such as the persian, siamese, devon rex cats or the sphynx that has no hair at all) and will therefore feel the cold more and will require special care. If you wanna get your sphynx cat some awesome clothes, there are 3 factors.</p>
