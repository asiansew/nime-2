<p>For cats and dogs, turkey is a lean meat that is a key ingredient in many pet foods. Fresher cuts of meat, however, are just fine in moderation. Too much ham is dangerous for dogs. I’m drooling so much you’d think i was pavlov’s cat. Obligate carnivores are animals who find meat as an essential component of their diet.</p>

<p>Be truly careful about the bones and ask your vet about the right amount of turkey that is appropriate for your loyal companion. Although ham is not the healthiest choice of meat that you can give your furry friend, your cat can still have ham. Generally you’ll only want to use cooked ham &amp; in moderation as a treat. Pork should always be cooked to an internal temperature of 140 f. Ham is rich in protein and fat, but the preservatives in it are not suitable for the dog.</p>

<p>Although cats love them, cured meats should only be given on occasion. Baby food is designed to nourish infant humans—omnivorous creatures who, unlike cats, can live without fresh raw meat, organs, and bones. I’m sure you can see the resemblance. Too much ham is dangerous for dogs. So for all pet owners, we rounded up a list of 20 common.</p>
