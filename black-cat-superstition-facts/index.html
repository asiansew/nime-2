<p>Some superstitious people will consider it bad luck if a black cat crosses their path. The pigmentation responsible for the black colour can break down in strong sunlight causing the colour of the fur to fade to a brown or rust like colour. Black cats are typically associated with bad luck and halloween, am i right? In fact, in early egyptian times, dating back as far as 3000 bc, cats (including black ones) were the rock stars of the animal world, held in high esteem; People often times believe in superstition and whenever something bad happens, they look for someone to blame.</p>

<p>A black cat crossing your path is a sign that something bad will befall you. It’s ok if one walks with you, behind you, or even directly in front of you. Superstitious greeks then began to link black cats with death and the afterlife. There are two places in the world that really buck the trend though. Well, i’m here to tell you that there is way more to this dark feline than bad luck and pumpkins.</p>
