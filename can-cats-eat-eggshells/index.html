<p>Eggshell consumption can result in healthier teeth, nails and coat in dogs, and the extra calcium can help birds lay stronger eggs. Your dog can certainly enjoy cooked eggs to get his protein fix, but did you know that he can also benefit from eating its shells? Cats need protein in their diet, and if you’re tired of feeding her commercial cat food, or if you just want to give her a special treat occasionally, then eggs are a great option. In fact, eggs can also be a great source of protein for cats. Small amounts of egg can be a great treat.</p>

<p>Not only can dogs eat eggshells, but they are also an excellent source of calcium, vitamins, amino acids and other essential nutrients. Some even consider eggs to be a superfood for cats. Eggshells actually offer a number of nutritional benefits for your cat. Given in moderation, eggshells can be a healthy addition to your pooch’s diet. Luckily, there’s an easy fix for this problem:</p>

<p>Dogs can eat a boiled egg with the shell. The main health benefit is in the form of calcium. Dogs and cats alike will benefit from the natural nutrients found in eggshells, without any of the additives found in many commercial supplements. Daily intake of 2.5 grams should be enough to meet your requirements, though speak to your health professional. (anything that goes in the sink is pure amazement to my cat.) and she jumps up, and grabs the egg shell and runs.</p>
