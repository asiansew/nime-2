Toadstools are also varieties of fungi, although they can sometimes be mistaken for mushrooms. Dogs have sweet receptors, too. These types of mushrooms are edible, healthy, and harmless for both humans and pets. However, we can attest to their safety at therapeutic levels for dogs, cats and tropical fish.</p>

<p>Mushrooms are not only a delicious accompaniment to many foods but are increasingly becoming a meat alternative for vegetarians and vegans. Start gradually with a small piece and observe your pooch in 24 hours. Knowledgable mushroom lovers all over the world wait until the fall of the year to pursue the robust oyster mushrooms that grow on trees in the wild. Cecidomyiidae is a small fly called gall gnats that eat the underside of the mushroom. However, cats shouldn’t eat wild mushrooms, as they can be poisonous, and mushrooms shouldn’t make up a significant portion of a cat’s diet.</p>

<p>Oyster mushrooms (pleurotus ostreatus) belong to a genus of some of the most commonly eaten mushrooms. The mycelia of oyster mushrooms will kill and eat bacteria and tiny worms called nematodes. However, cats shouldn’t eat wild mushrooms, as they can be poisonous, and mushrooms shouldn’t make up a significant portion of a cat’s diet. Just make sure not to give them too many. However, we can attest to their safety at therapeutic levels for dogs, cats and tropical fish.</p>
