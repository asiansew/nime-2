<p>Pork should always be cooked to an internal temperature of 140 f. It must be raw and not be cured. If your cat is having too much fat in their daily food diet. Pork bacon is considered dangerous because it is high in fat and salt. However, a slice of it every once in a while is considerably fine.</p>

<p>The answer to this question is… yes, they can! The cheese will not be good if your kitty is lactose intolerant. I’ve always heard people saying that pork is bad for cats, and you’ve probably heard similar too i bet. Omelette is not safe for cats if it has wild mushrooms, garlic, onions or chives. Bacon comes from pigs but curing bacon takes a lot of salt which is unhealthy.</p>
