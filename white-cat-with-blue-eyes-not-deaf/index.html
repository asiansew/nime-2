<p>A white cat with one blue eye has a 39% chance of at least partial deafness, and a white cat with two blue eyes may have a 65% chance. To see if a cat is deaf, try standing a few metres away from them and clapping your hands loudly. White cats need to inherit a particular gene or gene complex to be diagnosed deaf. You can test by clapping behind it�s back to see if it will react or make some other noise. Not all white cats with blue eyes are deaf.</p>

<p>White cats can have blue, gold, green or copper coloured odd eyes. White kitten with blue eyes are often be associated with blindness and deafness. In addition, cats with albinism are susceptible to suffering from both deafness and blindness. You can test by clapping behind it�s back to see if it will react or make some other noise. No, not all pure white cats with blue eyes are deaf, however:.</p>

<p>Well, opinions vary, and so do research conclusions. When the gene affects only one eye the cat will have odd eyes. The w gene responsible for white coat and blue eye is closely related to the hearing ability, and presence of a blue eye can indicate the cat is deaf to the side the blue eye is located. If the eye color of the cat is completely white, then blue eyes in cats is highly unlikely. Not all of these cats are deaf (see part 2 of this short article).</p>
