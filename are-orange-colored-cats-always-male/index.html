<p>Any cat, male or female, can be orange, but in males the color is nearly always expressed in the tabby (striped) pattern, sometimes called a ginger tom. All orange tabby cats are male (myth) orange tabby cats are some of the most recognized of the bunch. So, apparently tortoiseshell cats (which can have orange and black and tabby markings) are usually female and ginger, or marmalade cats are usually male. On average, 99.9% of the tricolor cats, whose coat has three colors: Eumelanin (either brown or black) and pheomelanin (red). Unlike other cats that are named after their breed, ginger cats are named after the color of their coat which is basically orange.</p>

<p>This is a really interesting fact and it tells us that sex and coat color genetics are somehow related, at least in orange cats. This certainly seems to point to some genetic link between sex and coat markings, although veterinarians and researchers still haven’t seemed to pinpoint the exact factors. All tri colored cats are not considered calico�s or tortie�s duke is white with 2 varieties of orange on him and is definately not a calico. There are three types of melanin. They purr and meow a lot and will always want to be.</p>

<p>First of all, we do know why most orange cats are male. And it’s not some sort of magic — it’s genetics. Tortishell is a recessive gene on the x chromosome, so only females are torti and the males usually present as orange tabby. If you�re on the hunt for orange tabby cat facts, you�ll have to focus on his looks, rather than personality. All red cats are tabby cats.</p>

<p>Because in order for a male to be a calico, he must have. Cats change colour as they mature, and as the seasons change. This is because when cats of a certain color get together, the females will often present with tortishell markings. Male cats can only be: *this is because the “ginger gene” which produces the orange color is on the x chromosome.</p>

<p>The ‘ginger gene’ which produces the orange colour is on the x chromosome. Eumelanin (either brown or black) and pheomelanin (red). There are three types of melanin. All a female would need is the gene for orange and not have a gene for black, therefore producing an orange cat right?

<p>As you may recall from high school biology, mammals have two chromosomes that determine their sex—xx for females and xy for males. Like cats themselves, cat genetics are not always simple and straightforward. Swirled, mackerel, spotted or ticked, enchanting tabby cats have a distinctive, recognizable coat pattern, regardless of breed. And it’s not some sort of magic — it’s genetics. Solid, tabby, bicolour, colorpoint and are rarely calico or tortoiseshell.</p>

Although some red cats (usually dilutes) may appear to be a solid color, upon closer examination, you will see the pale stripes, whorls, or spots of the tabby.

<p>One of the common myths about orange tabby cats is that they are all male. This is a really interesting fact and it tells us that sex and coat color genetics are somehow related, at least in orange cats. While it’s true that a higher percentage of orange tabbies are male, the ratio is actually about 80 percent male to 20 percent female. There is no monetary value, per se, associated with a female orange tabby cat. Females have two x chromosomes and so need two copies of this gene to become ginger.</p>

<p>We have many female orange tabby cats in my practice. Eumelanin (either brown or black) and pheomelanin (red). Calico and tortoiseshell cats, however, are almost always female. While it’s true that a higher percentage of orange tabbies are male, the ratio is actually about 80 percent male to 20 percent female. I have read that one of the genes for color is on the x chromosome, so males can have any one color plus white, whereas females can be calico.</p>
