<p>Cat�s cradle deadeye dick galapagos god bless you, mr. A book that left an indelible mark on an entire generation of readers, cat’s cradle is one of the twentieth century’s most important works—and vonnegut at his very best. The main characters of this fiction, classics story are bokonon, angela hoenikker. An apocalyptic tale of this planet’s ultimate fate, it features a midget as the protagonist, a complete, original theology created by a calypso singer, and a vision of the future that is at once blackly. I can not review “so it goes” without it being in his voice, due to the fact that he did perfectly that sensation of disconnectedness (lethargy?) from today that is, to me, a big part of the charm of guide.</p>
