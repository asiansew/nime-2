Birds can eat the older rotting apples, but you can also slice ripe ones up and offer them on your feeder. Lemons, oranges and limes are all unhealthy for cats, as are the fruit, peelings and seeds of grapefruit. The cat can extract some useful nutrients such as calcium, vitamins and pectin from it.</p>

<p>Well, although many experts have mixed reviews about apples. Cats should not eat oranges and any other citrus fruits. Most cats won’t eat oranges but if your cat did decide to eat oranges it will lead a bad case of diarrhea and vomiting. The short answer is no. However, some cats really love the taste of oranges, and if your cat is one of them, there is no reason not to give it orange.</p>

<p>Fruits and veggies for pets apple. The short answer is no. Most cats will not go near anything that has a citrus taste to it. Can my cat eat carrots? All parts of the orange tree, including the leaves, peels, and interior portion of the fruit, contain essential oils that are harmful to cats.</p>
