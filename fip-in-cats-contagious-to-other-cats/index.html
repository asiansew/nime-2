And may explain the uncommon epizootics of fip where a number of cats in the same environment develop fip within a days or weeks of each other. Dogs, humans and other species cannot be infected. Although fip may commonly strike an entire litter of kittens, my experience tells me unrelated adult cats rarely pass the fatal form of the virus between each other. However, only about 5% of cats ever develop fip.</p>

<p>Chylothorax is more common in cats than dogs. Despite the name of this disease, it does not always cause peritonitis (inflammation of the lining of the abdomen), but this complication happens in a large percentage of infected cats. Chronic bronchitis in dogs is neither infectious nor contagious. Scientists believe that, in these cases, the virus mutates inside the body, and then the cat�s own immune system mounts an inappropriate response to it and aids in its spread. Feline infectious peritonitis or fip in cats is an immune reaction to the infection of feline coronavirus (fcov).</p>

<p>Thanks to a lifetime of dedication and devotion, dr niels pedersen of uc davis discovered the cure for fip: All cats should be tested for fiv, and retested any time they’re sick with infection, adopted into a new home, or exposed to other infected cats. Feline infectious peritonitis is a very special reaction to infection with the feline enteric coronavirus. However in the vast majority of cats the virus does not cause disease at all. Typically a cat with dry fip will show ocular or neurological signs.</p>

<p>It is, without a doubt, the most dreaded infectious disease of cats. Typically a cat with dry fip will show ocular or neurological signs. And may explain the uncommon epizootics of fip where a number of cats in the same environment develop fip within a days or weeks of each other. Although the i in fip stands for infectious, the syndrome usually does not spread from one cat to another. Many of the clinical signs of fip are vague and occur with other diseases found in cats.</p>
