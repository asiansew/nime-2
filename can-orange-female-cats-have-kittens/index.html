A dominant color can produce both dominant and dilute kittens, but a dilute color bred to a dilute color will only produce dilute colored kittens. In the cat, the gene for the orange color is located on the x chromosome and is recessive. Some people are telling me i have caught the parents, but i am not sure if this is possible genetically. Abyssinians are favored for the orange ticked pattern. I have actually only had my hands on one orange female, i have a deposit on her with a local rescue group.</p>

<p>Then i googled if it was rare, and they say both parent have to be red so there would could be a red orange female, but her parents were orange (father) and dark grey. I have seen a few orange and white females in my search, mama cats that were not friendly. To get an orange female kitten, both the mother and father must be orange, konecny says. Remember that blue is the dilute of black, and cream is the dilute of red. My other cats don�t drool.</p>

<p>If a mother cat is orange, her male kittens will be orange regardless of their father’s color, konecny says, and if a mother cat is tortoiseshell (a mix of black, white and orange), half of her male kittens will be orange while the other half will be black. She can be a little skittish, but she is quite the lover. In the cat, the gene for the orange color is located on the x chromosome and is recessive. What color kittens will these cats have?

<p>Orange cats can have long or short hair. What color kittens would a male orange tabby and a female orange tabby cat have? I have never seen a orange female cat, especially one with deep blue eyes.

<p>It is not uncommon for a female cat to adopt another female�s litter of kittens, but sometimes females can be hostile toward litters that are not their own. Males only have to inherit one orange gene to appear orange, while females have to inherit two. I have an all black female that was the runt of a litter and she’s the dominant one of the 2. Between dominant genes, modifier genes, white spotting, and different fathers, no wonder kittens in a litter can have a variety of coat colours. Please note, these cats are from rescues and shelters nationwide and are not available through the aspca.</p>

<p>In other words, male orange cats always come from mothers with an orange gene, but female orange cats also require a father with the same gene. What color kittens would a male orange tabby and a female orange tabby cat have?

<p>In addition to being a real purr machine, momo the orange tabby cat seeks affection every waking. We have 2 female orange tabbies, but one has a white spot on her neck. The genes that cause the suppression of color are stronger than the genes for any color including the mighty orange. The eldest orange tabby cats are brother and sister, both standard sized tabby cats, then i have a miniature male orange tabby, now him, he’ll eat forever and never gain weight! No shots or deworming (could do for extra cost)</p>

<p>Remember that blue is the dilute of black, and cream is the dilute of red. In other words, male orange cats always come from mothers with an orange gene, but female orange cats also require a father with the same gene. This is because the gene that causes a cat to be orange is linked to sex, and statistically most orange cats are boys. Orange cats can have long or short hair. One was all white, one was a grey tabby, the other was an orange tabby and the last was an all black cat.</p>

<p>Orange cats can have long or short hair. But earlier in the year there was a litter of kittens, sadly all dead now, on the road or through foxes, who included red and grey tabbies, white and solid grey. As if coat colour genetics isn’t confusing enough, a litter of kittens may also have more than one father as a female cat in heat will mate with one male if given the opportunity. We have 6 beautiful kittens, 3 orange and white (tabby) 2 females 1 male $200.00 3 black all female $150.00 they are very playful and are good with children. Males only have to inherit one orange gene to appear orange, while females have to inherit two.</p>

<p>No shots or deworming (could do for extra cost) They are not specifically bred to have orange spots, but sometimes when a litter of kittens are born genetics will play a role. Ive heard that cats can have kittens by multiple different male cats tho,so all the kittens might not have had the same dad. This has nothing to do with multiple fathers. I have 3 orange tabbies currently.</p>

In addition to being a real purr machine, momo the orange tabby cat seeks affection every waking. Orange kittens are associated with being fiery and spunky.they are known for their colorful personalities. 2 males and 1 female, lazy you say, not a chance here. These felines certainly live up to the hype and they have some features that are exclusive to their genetics.</p>

<p>Since white isn’t a color and is merely hiding the genes for color, white cats often produce colored kittens. Use the nationwide database of cats looking for good homes below! Search by zip code to meet available cats in your area. I think they are including orange and white as well. All cats are unique and awesome in their own way, but orange tabby cats have a special place in many peoples’ hearts.</p>

<p>The orange mutant gene is found only on the x, or female, chromosome. Long haired breeds such as persians, maine coons and american curl can have the orange tabby pattern. We have the sweetest and strangest female orange tabby with no white on her, cassie. Note that the o gene is on the x chromosome, so females have two and males only have one: She can be a little skittish, but she is quite the lover.</p>

<p>To get an orange female kitten, both the mother and father must be orange, konecny says. I heard cats can have multiple fathers and i was wondering if you could tell what color her kittens will be. They are not specifically bred to have orange spots, but sometimes when a litter of kittens are born genetics will play a role. I have an all black female that was the runt of a litter and she’s the dominant one of the 2. One was all white, one was a grey tabby, the other was an orange tabby and the last was an all black cat.</p>
