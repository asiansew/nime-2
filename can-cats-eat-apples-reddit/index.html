<p>Only give your dog apple slices if he is old enough and able to digest it. You can have some of those today, but not every day. Yes, all dogs can eat apples, from great danes to chihuahuas, yorkies, or pomeranians. There�s lots of fruit and veggies that they can and can�t eat so it�s a good idea to have a quick google search before feeding them something new. (rip bonito) that loved peas also.</p>
