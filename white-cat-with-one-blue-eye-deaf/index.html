Felines with a single blue eye are often deaf in one hear (usually the ear on the same side as their blue eye), while two blue eyes make an ivory cat likely to suffer total deafness in both ears. Again, this is not always the case. When it comes to white cats, they can be deaf no matter the eye color. This is a feline form of complete heterochromia.</p>

<p>White cats with one blue eye (the other is usually yellow or gold) have about a 40% chance of being deaf in both or one ear. Usually, not always the side with the blue eye is the deaf eye. These cats will have hearing loss on the same side that she has a blue eye. White cats with one blue eye and one yellow eye are often deaf on the ear on the side of the blue eye (left eye blue: A white cat with one blue eye has a 39% chance of at least partial deafness, and a white cat with two blue eyes may have a 65% chance.</p>

<p>White cats can have blue, gold, green or copper coloured odd eyes. The other may be green, copper or brown. Cats with blue eyes can sometimes have visual or auditory deficiencies. White spotted cats are rarely deaf and the once that are are mostly high grade white but i guess low grade white spotting can cause deafness id the white spotting runs over the ear. 40 percent of white cats with one blue eye were deaf;</p>

<p>Of course, a potential owner will want to know the chances of her white cat being deaf. Heterochromia can be inherited, congenital or acquired. The selkirk rex is a cat breed from the united states, 1988. Deafness can occur in white cats with yellow, green or blue irises, although it is mostly likely in white cats with blue irises. Some of these cats are deaf in only one ear.</p>
