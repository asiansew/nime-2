<p>I am selling my 2 lovely cats due to sadly not having time for them anymore, looking for the perfect home for them, they are indoor cats due to missy being deaf. It’s important to remember that not all white cats with blue eyes are naturally deaf. If 40 percent of these cats are deaf, it means the majority (60 percent) can hear. However, today angoras in different colors are being accepted as purebred. Hereditary deafness is a major concern in white cats, and even more so if one or both irises are blue in color.</p>

<p>White cats need to inherit a particular gene or gene complex to be diagnosed deaf. When cats with the (w) gene are bred, the resulting litters have the chance to inherit faulty hearing. Moreover, all siamese kittens are born white, developing darker colors as they grow. You can help a deaf cat lead a happy,. Contrary to popular belief, white cats are no more likely than any other coat color to be deaf.</p>

<p>I am selling my 2 lovely cats due to sadly not having time for them anymore, looking for the perfect home for them, they are indoor cats due to missy being deaf. Repeated exposure to the sun, especially on hairless areas like the ears. Still, look at it this way: Cats can suffer from hearing loss due to increasing age, chronic ear infections, or may be born with a defect. An estimated 40 percent of white cats with blue eyes are deaf, which is high.</p>
