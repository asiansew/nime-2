Some, but not all, cats may become lethargic and lose. If you notice any discharge coming from your cat’s eyes wipe it away using a fresh cotton ball. If your cat recently sustains an eye injury, take.</p>

<p>Why are my cat�s eyes watering? It is not uncommon for kittens with an eye infection to have their eyelids stuck shut by discharge. Most instances of watery eyes in cats are nothing to worry about. Fights with other cats can lead to injuries to the eyes that cause them to water. Causes of eye injury in cats include:</p>

<p>Cats have also a third “eyelid,” a thick membrane that protects the eye from scratches and debris. Any change to the eyes or eyelids should be addressed within 24 hours, if not sooner. It also helps to fight off any infections. Cats are unfortunately prone to the odd fight and one of the most common injuries is a claw scratch across the eyeball, ouch! Often problems with the eyes are due to infection and other illnesses, though that can be precipitated by injuries to the eye(s) or eyelid(s), which we will discuss here.</p>

<p>It will usually sort itself out after a few days. This will also clear the sinuses of your cat. When a cat has a flat face, a small nose and large, round eyes, the tears tend to spill over the eye rims. Colds can also lead to conjunctivitis, particularly if the cold is caused by herpes, chlamydia, or mycoplasma. The most common reason for cats’ eyes injure is fighting (just like eye watering in cats).</p>
