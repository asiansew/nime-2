<p>One of my cats has always had giant pupils, in all kinds of light. A cat�s eyes are very expressive and can tell you a lot about her mood and health. You can test this by putting some obstacles in a corridor and watch to see if they bounce into things or their whiskers are pointing right forward all the time so they �feel� their way around using their whiskers. Dilated eyes (actually the pupils) look like the eyes in the photo below. The pupil constricts or dilates (enlarges) according to the amount of light that enters the eyes, with both pupils normally dilating in dim light and constricting in bright light.</p>

<p>But occasional dilation can be caused by contentment, excitement, and most often the level of light in her surroundings. When i picked him up his eyes were permanently dilated. Also, her eyes seem to reflect different colors. Glaucoma in cats is a disease that involves increased pressure of fluid inside the eye (aqueous humor). Bites and scratches from cats sometimes lead to dangerous infections, so play it safe.</p>

<p>My cats eyes have always been dilated even in the sun. Why are my cats eyes always dilated? Siamese cats have blue eyes, but their eyes frequently glow yellow. Cats eyes why are my cats eyes always dilated? Her eyes are always dilated.</p>
