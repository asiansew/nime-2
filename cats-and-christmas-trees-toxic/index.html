<p>Artificial trees are normally made of pvc (polyvinyl chloride). In addition to cancer concerns, pvc can contain harmful additives to impart certain characteristics on. Artificial christmas trees contain toxins in the materials used to make the christmas tree. This evening, i read a couple of articles online stating that the flocking on trees is toxic to pets!!! (and does your cat go along with what most cats do anyway?) there are two points of concern with eating needles from live christmas trees:</p>

<p>In addition to cancer concerns, pvc can contain harmful additives to impart certain characteristics on. Cats tend to be very. The holidays are like a gift that keeps on giving. So i am out voted.

<p>This is because the needles on a real tree are sharp and can pierce or puncture the skin of an overly curious cat, while the pine needles themselves are irritating to mildly toxic if chewed (depending on the species of tree used). Ingesting pine needles can cause liver damage or even death, according to cat behavior expert marilyn krieger. Real christmas trees can make cats sick.

Cat’s are curious creatures and while they may nibble at your tree or the ornaments strung on the tree, they usually don’t make it a habit of eating plastic. Artificial trees are normally made of pvc (polyvinyl chloride). I have heard that they are toxic to cats so i was not a huge fan of having a christmas tree (unless it was a fake christmas tree) but then my other house mate said that he wanted a christmas tree too.</p>
