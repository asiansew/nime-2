<p>What we can do to ensure that our pet has a healthy and balanced diet. Still, peas should be given to cats as treats and not in their regular diet. When making a decision about whether cats can eat carrots raw, you have to consider the fact that carrots can be a serious choking hazard for your cat. Cats can eat both lentils and peas, but only in small amounts. Carrots are lauded as one of the most nutritious vegetables for humans.</p>

<p>Carrots are a safe and popular option for cats, small amounts of cooked carrot can actually be good for cats as long as you only offer it occasionally. Carrots are nontoxic (even if your kitty decides to go on a carrot binge, they will not be at any risk of toxicity), low in calories, and full of fiber and micronutrients that may offer some. Some cats who eat dry food diets suffer from digestive problems that can be alleviated by supplementing their diet with small amounts of plant fiber. In addition to being loaded with dietary fiber, carrots are also rich in vitamin c, vitamin k, potassium, and manganese. They need to eat meat in order to survive.</p>
