<p>That means that they don�t necessarily give off zero fel d1 protein. Bengal cats are known to be one of the most hypoallergenic cat breeds, but they don’t seem to produce less fel d1 (the protein that causes allergic reaction in humans) than other cats. Most people who are allergic to cats have either no allergic reaction or a more milder reaction to bengal cats when compared to the majority of other breeds. Technically however, there really are no domestic cats that are 100% hypoallergenic. Hypoallergenic refers to something less likely to cause allergic reactions.</p>

<p>Like all cats, bengal cats do indeed have dander. Bengal cat have created the highest ten most hypoallergenic cat list for several reasons. With their silky, unique coat, bengal’s don’t have the need to groom themselves excessively as most cats, which is considered to be the main reason why bengals don’t cause an allergic reaction that often as other breeds. While the main causes of these allergies will be discussed in a while, let’s first establish the unique fact about bengal cats that they are hypoallergenic. I would not recommend purchasing a bengal until you are 100% sure he will be ok with it.</p>

<p>Regular brushing is usually considered to be about once a week on average. Most people who are allergic to cats have either no allergic reaction or a more milder reaction to bengal cats when compared to the majority of other breeds. Since fel d 1 allergen is secreted mostly in a cat’s saliva, this means that bengal cats have less allergen on their fur. However, as we’ll get to later, they may not have as much dander as other cats which could mean that they are hypoallergenic. It means relatively unlikely to cause an allergic reaction. in comparison to other cat breeds, bengal cats are less likely to cause an allergic reaction in people, and here is why.</p>
