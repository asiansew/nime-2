<p>A cat may hiss at another cat or animal if it feels threatened because it doesn’t know the other animal. Your reaction may be to approach or reprove the cat, but his hissing action should override your impulse. Felines will hiss as a warning, making humans and other animals aware that they should stay away from them. Maybe bringing your cat home from the vet and allowing them to roam upstairs while your other cat(s) are downstairs for a few hours can be helpful. My cat is hissing at me because of new kitten.</p>

<p>It means, “back up, stay away from me.” I have had many pet cats and we have had three at a time!!!! According to koski, “mother cats will hiss if someone comes too close to their kittens,” whether it’s a person or other animal. Often times the older cats will appear sad, reclusive, hiss a lot, and sometimes even stop eating if it isn�t adjusting well to the new member of the family. So, if you notice your cat hissing at you, it is giving you a warning that it is ready to attack if necessary.</p>
