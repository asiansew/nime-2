<p>A white cat with one blue eye has a 39% chance of at least partial deafness, and a white cat with two blue eyes may have a 65% chance. The gene responsible is pleiotropic. Blue eyed white cats do have a higher risk of being deaf than other cats, but they�re not all deaf. In one 1997 study of white cats, 72% of the animals were found to be totally deaf. Once again, the brilliant scientist was right since between 56% and 90% of cats (according to different studies) with white coat and blue eye color are deaf from one or both ears. Deafness can occur in white cats with yellow, green or blue irises, although it is mostly likely in white cats with blue irises.</p>

A pure white cat with blue eyes has an 85 percent chance of some degree of deafness. The gene responsible is pleiotropic. And 65 to 85 percent of white cats with two blue eyes were deaf. Is that true, and why? Around 40% of cats with white fur and blue eyes are deaf.</p>

<p>Cats with just one deaf ear may appear perfectly normal, and their problem may never become known to their human companions. Interestingly, if a white cat with one blue eye is deaf in only one ear, that ear will invariably be on the same side of the head as the blue eye. Albino cats are not linked to deafness. The reason, as you may have guessed, is heredity: You can help a deaf cat lead a happy, full life by keeping it protected indoors and learning to use visual signals and vibrations to communicate.</p>

<p>But they are just like any normal cat and if you have the time then there are people that can help you train them. If 40 percent of these cats are deaf, it means the majority (60 percent) can hear. Once again, the brilliant scientist was right since between 56% and 90% of cats (according to different studies) with white coat and blue eye color are deaf from one or both ears. &lt;br /&gt; the genes for deafness and pigmentation are allelic to each other and are expressed in equal proportion.&lt;br /&gt; the gene for pigmentation masks the gene for hearing.&lt;br /&gt; a single gene is responsible for pigmentation and hearing.&lt;br /&gt; nextreset While this could be true to some extent, it doesn’t make black and white cats that much different from other cats of the same breed.</p>

But they are just like any normal cat and if you have the time then there are people that can help you train them. There is a relationship between white cats with blue eyes and genetic deafness, though not all cats with this combination will be affected. Cats, however, often have eyes that look very pale blue, pink, or red. About half of all white cats are deaf, and those numbers increase in cats with blue eyes, with deafness often found on the same side as the blue eye — left blue eye, deaf in left ear;</p>

Blue eyed white cats do have a higher risk of being deaf than other cats, but they�re not all deaf. Of white cats with one blue eye, about 40 percent are deaf in at least one ear.
