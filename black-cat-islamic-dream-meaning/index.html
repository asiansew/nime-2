<p>Islamic dream interpration about black cat: In dreams it can represent the concept that you have of femininity in general, or a very precise woman. A living cat that is seen dead in a dream also predicts serious financial. If a dreamer stumbles across a black cat in a dream (and they carry this negative association with a cat of this color), it could mean that they are fearful of listening to their inner intuition or connecting to and owning their feminine power. To experience cat attacks is a dream that should not be ignored.</p>
