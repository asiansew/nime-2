<p>The world’s opinion has always been mixed about black cats. This is partially because cats tend to roam or wander at night because they are nocturnal. 3* if a black cat comes across you in the morning, it brings you a bad luck.

<p>In germany, the meaning of this superstition is the same, but the distinction is made between whether the cat crosses the path from the left to the right and vice versa.

This is partially because cats tend to roam or wander at night because they are nocturnal.</p>
