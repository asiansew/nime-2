When it is too cold for humans to sleep outside, then it is also too cold for feral cats or stray cats. First, determine if the animal is a feral cat, a stray, or someone’s pet. But this doesn’t mean it can keep your cat warm in the winter.</p>

<p>You’re going to learn if cats can actually survive winter (especially in those areas where it gets extremely cold) so if you have an outdoor cat and worried about your little feline friend being outside in winter then you’re in the right place! When it is too cold for humans to sleep outside, then it is also too cold for feral cats or stray cats. Do you take care of feral cats (unsocialized to people) that roam outside and do you provide them a soft place to sleep as well as provide them with fresh water and food to eat? If you let them in and they go to a warm place in your home, then you know it will be because it was too cold for them outside. If you have an indoor cat, then you do not have to worry too much about trying to keep your cat warm.</p>

<p>One important factor to bear in mind is to keep windows closed, as well as doors, to avoid a cold stream of air from passing through the house. Other risks for cats in winter. When the thermometer dips below freezing, it is important to protect your cats from the cold spell. Feral cats need help during the cold months just as much as indoor cats do. Letting your cat outside when it’s cold “if you can’t go outside in a regular jacket then your cat shouldn’t.</p>

<p>This is not always possible, though. Generally speaking, as soon as the temperature drops below freezing, cats become at risk for winding up in dangerous situations. It’s easy to do with the right items. Cats are hardy animals, but they can get sick like any other living creature. Cats trying to shelter from the cold often crawl into car engines where there is some warmth left over from when the car was last driven, so check underneath before you drive off.</p>
