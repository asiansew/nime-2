<p>The health benefits of pumpkin for cats. Pumpkin spice products are usually flavored with a mix of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice. Pumpkin pie is filled with sugar and spices, so you should only feed your dog pure pumpkin or unseasoned seeds. Both cooked potato and cooked sweet potato are a safe treat for your kitty. But like the pumpkin, watch out for seasoned or even salted cans;</p>

<p>Cats can eat pumpkin seeds as long as they’ve been cleaned and roasted at 350°f for an hour so. However, it’s best to not feed your dog any pumpkin pie filling or canned pumpkin that has added sweeteners and spices. But, you should not add any added sugar and spice to pumpkin. Do not give your cat raw pumpkin, pumpkin pulp, or the stem or skin of the pumpkin. If your cat is on a prescription diet or has a history of food allergies, consult your veterinarian before feeding pumpkin.</p>

<p>Cats can eat pumpkin seeds as long as they’ve been cleaned and roasted at 350°f for an hour so. If you buy a pie pumpkin, save the seeds to plant next year or buy pie pumpkin seeds to plant. Pie filling is also not a pure, whole food like real pumpkin is. “many cats enjoy the pumpkin flavor so much they are happy to lick pumpkin straight from the spoon,” dr. There is a longer processing time in the pressure canner, but it is so worth the effort.</p>
