<p>Do cats snore while awake? This means your cat is asleep for more than half of his entire life. They are all well albeit a pound or two heavier than they should be and see a vet for their annual physical. Snoring in cats may be a more common phenomenon than you think. Cats purr when they are happy, or as a way of comforting themselves.</p>

<p>Yep, that’s snoring you hear. In terms of cats, the study found that as many as 7% of cats who slept in the same room as their owners were guilty of snoring. Healthy cats can also snore. Surely they purr and make all sorts of noises, but i didn’t expect them to snore. Sleeping cats who snore are most often those who are more relaxed.</p>
