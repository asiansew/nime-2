<p>Puppies can get parvo from the beach and it can even live in sand for up to 7 years! Canine parvovirus can live for many months outside of an infected animal. While dogs can get parvo in a similar way to cats, the two diseases are different. The same cannot be said for the reverse situation, as studies have shown that a mutated strain of the canine parvovirus can infect cats. Parvo in cats can spread to other cats, but can’t infect other species.</p>

<p>An unprotected dog can get parvo by coming into contact with the actual virus. It can be transmitted by any person, animal or object that comes in contact with an infected dog’s feces. An unprotected dog can get parvo by coming into contact with the actual virus. But if you�re referring to the dog parvo virus, cats cannot get that. Parvo often causes puppies to get dehydrated from excessive diarrhea and vomiting.and dogs with parvo are also at a high risk of developing.</p>

<p>The parvovirus that occurs in puppies cannot jump species and infect cats or people. Both kittens and puppies also can receive important antibodies from their mothers while nursing. They most often have much more mild clinical signs than dogs do, but there is a strain of canine parvovirus that can cause severe illness in cats. Whether dogs can get parvo from other animals is important considering that dogs may be exposed to wild life. Does it mean your pooch is going to die if you do not get him the treatment?</p>
