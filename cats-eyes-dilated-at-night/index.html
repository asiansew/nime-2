The dilated pupils, panting, fast movement, and inability to stay still indicate the dog is over aroused due to excitement. El glaucoma in cats it is a disease that involves increasing the pressure of the fluid inside the eye (aqueous humor). Last night, there was some discharge coming from it and after i cleaned it out, his pupil was the same size as the other one.</p>

<p>Dilated pupils can signify serious infection, head or brain trauma or tumor, poisoning, or disease and will need diagnostic tests to determine the cause. This suggests that your cat’s pupils are unnecessarily dilated, attracting more light than is required. Old cats eyes seem to always be dilated. If caught early, retinal detachments can sometimes be treated. They will get smaller with light but the pupils are twice as big as my other cats.</p>

<p>At a shelter, a volunteer returns to the room with a dog. On dust bunnies, on slippers, on all the toys my children have left strewn about the house. Your cat’s large, round eyes are designed to operate far better in low light conditions and the dark than our eyes. My cat�s eyes are very dilated. Heat does not cause a change in pupil size, and there may be something going on with your cats brain or neurologic system that needs attention.</p>
