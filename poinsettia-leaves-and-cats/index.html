<p>Yet another common ornamental flower is the carnation. Since then, poinsettia plants have a earned a bad reputation and are considered as extremely poisonous. Although poinsettias can cause mouth and stomach irritation, according to the pet poison helpline, the level of toxicity to cats is usually mild to low. The truth is, a kid would have to eat about 500 poinsettia leaves to get sick. Remove leaves from the soil surface, and add a little more potting soil if the roots are visible.</p>

<p>Skin contact with the sap of a poinsettia plant can cause a rash. If the leaves are ingested, they will often cause nausea and vomiting, but it would take a large amount of the plant’s material to cause poisoning, and most animals and children won’t eat such a large enough amount. If there is any sap on your dog&amp;rsquo;s exterior, he will decontaminate the dog by flushing with water and using a mild detergent to wash the dog. The history of the poinsettia has led to a lot of misinformation about this plant. Although poinsettias can cause mouth and stomach irritation, according to the pet poison helpline, the level of toxicity to cats is usually mild to low.</p>
