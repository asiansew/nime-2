The herb that strips cats of their dignity read more » June 15th is world catnip awareness day. Apparently, catnip produces a similar reaction to dabbling with lsd or marijuana (although let’s assume that no cats were actually subjected to such drugs in the name of catnip research). Smelling catnip is a stimulant for cats, getting them very excited.</p>

<p>Let sit for 10 minutes; Catnip is a friend to humans, too. Here�s a delightful short video about cat reactions to catnip starring two special cats, cole &amp; marmalade. There’s something that makes a cat owner want to see their cat go insane and act like a drunkard, and catnip is usually the answer. Lions, tigers, panthers, and your common domestic tabby just can�t seem to get enough of this fragrant herb.</p>

<p>It has also been used to treat headaches, scarlet fever, coughing, insomnia &amp; smallpox. Catnip tea is made from the leaves and flowers of the common catnip plant, (nepeta cataria) a member of the mint family also known as catmint, catswort, and field balm. Response to catnip is genetically inherited, with about 70 to 80 percent of cats exhibiting the typical response to the plant. As stated before, smelling catnip and eating it have two very different effects on a cat. If you’re skeptical that catnip tea would be something that your cat would enjoy, the video below may end up changing your mind.</p>

<p>With your kittens, why not toss back a glass of warm goat’s milk? I recommend this stainless steel basket infuser to make straining this tea super simple. Catnip is a friend to humans, too. Catnip can be used for medicinal purposes it can be drank as a tea to help calm an upset stomach or help with sleep. You can use it either by drinking a warm catnip tea with ginger.</p>
