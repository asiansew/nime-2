<p>The man said that it was definitely a boy because the girls are rare and he wouldn�t just give one away because they�re worth a bit of money. When you are in need of a pure breed male calico cat, you can expect to pay handsomely since such a cat occurs through a miracle or luck. Savannahs can be classified into five types from f1 to f5.

Most male calicos are sterile (can�t reproduce) which saves you on getting them fixed i suppose, but no, just being a male calico won�t get you any money.</p>
