<p>Black cats and luck — an overview. Black cats bringing bad luck is a false statement derived from the middle ages, when black cats were associated with the practice of witchcraft. Although black cats can appear dangerous due to their color and cats’ quick and sneaky demeanor, they will not give you a lifetime of bad luck. The relationship of humans with felines dates back a long time. The fears about black cats spread throughout europe over time and, sadly, mass killings of black cats took place.</p>

<p>Black cats aren’t only associated with bad luck and evil though, in some cultures they are celebrated and seen as a sign of good luck. Interestingly enough, there are other myths surrounding black cats as well. That may be part of it, but i think a larger part is the hangover from this medieval belief that black cats are bad news. The idea that black cats are bad luck most likely began in europe in the middle ages. Typically associated with halloween, witches, and bad luck, these poor creatures are not only being overlooked in shelters but also avoided, and sometimes, even threatened.</p>
