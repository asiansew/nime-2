<p>The bigger and more ferocious looking, the better the public liked it. There are so many reasons why private ownership of exotic cats and their hybrids should be banned, and yet only one reason to allow it; These hybrid cats not only compete with other natural predators but may even cross breed with bobcats and eventually cougars over time, thus causing even more damage to existing native species. The tigon is not currently as common as the converse hybrid, the liger. However, there is an expanded definition of big cats that includes the cheetah, snow leopard, cougar (mountain lion/puma), clouded leopard and sunda clouded leopard.</p>

<p>The bigger and more ferocious looking, the better the public liked it. Big eyes and a stocky build define this big domestic cat breed, which was originally bred as a working cat, used to control rodents in british alleys and barns. In very isolated populations where there is no mate of the appropriate species available. While they are typically energetic and playful, there is some. Unlike lions who sleep and roll around for 90% of their entire lives, jaguars are more active and are spending their time hunting cooler prey.</p>

<p>A tigon is a hybrid cross between a male tiger (panthera tigris) and a female lion (panthera leo). Though this kind of species and breeds crossing does not usually appear in nature, with the intervention of humans, we now have zonkeys, ligers, and savannah cats. A popular hybrid, savannah cats are taller than typical house cats and look like small cheetahs. Here are the list of possible hybrid big cats (and some other smaller felines). Most, if not all hybrid big cats vary in size, and also have unique markings.</p>
