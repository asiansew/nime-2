Sand cats will fall under the umbrella term as a �wild cat�, and most laws ban these animals because of the lethality of �big cats�, despite the presence of smaller species that are not more dangerous than domestic cats. Some are killed by humans who consider them a threat to their livestock. Does the sand cat make a good pet. The fishing cat is endangered mostly because of habitat loss.</p>

<p>But this species is threatened by hunting and collection for the pet trade. There are four species on each continent, believed to be related to dogs, cats and pandas. Sand cats live in temperatures that sometimes rise to more than 40°c (104°f). But unlike the snow leopard, there is far less. Sand cats will also cover large kills with sand and return later to feed.</p>

<p>Sand cats will also cover large kills with sand and return later to feed. They are very sensitive animals, and do not do well in facilities not equipped for their needs. Other threats include domestic dogs which kill the sand cats, domestic cats that carry disease, and being caught in traps set out to capture jackals and foxes. Because they are hunted by pochers I don’t see cats in captivity as charming.</p>
