But occasional dilation can be caused by contentment, excitement, and most often the level of light in her surroundings. Therefore, if your cat has dilated pupils asymmetrically, you should go to the veterinarian to find the underlying cause, since the treatment will depend on it.</p>

<p>He eats and drinks water, purrs a lot and still runs around and can jump up high. She is still purring and wanting attention, she isn�t aggressive or anything. My cat manny�s eyes have been dilated and stay that way even in the light? When i turned to check on miss kitty, i happened to look at her eyes and noticed that her right eye is completely dilated. Snakes, scorpions, spiders, and ticks are all common sources of venom toxicity in cats.</p>

<p>Dilated (large) pupils are another source of understanding the meaning of cats’ mysterious eyes, and often indicate an excited cat. Therefore, if your cat has dilated pupils asymmetrically, you should go to the veterinarian to find the underlying cause, since the treatment will depend on it. Or take her outside in your arms for a bit on a sunny day and see what they do. She has always had very striking big eyes. Siamese cats have blue eyes, but their eyes frequently glow yellow.</p>
