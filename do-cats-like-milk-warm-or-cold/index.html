<p>There is special milk for baby kittens or baby dogs are cats warm blooded? The only milk you can or should feed your cat is that specifically designed for cats, for example wiskas cat milk. You do not need to feed your cat any milk unless it is just a kitten under six weeks old. While they are not nocturnal, they are often up at odd hours during the night and this can cause disturbances for owners. Kittens might like to have it on the warmer side because they associate it with their mothers milk but they might not be like other kittens and want it colder.</p>

<p>Some cats prefer moving water rather than drinking from a bowl, so using a cat fountain may encourage her to drink more. Some cats also like to drink warm water. Goats milk is much better than cow�s milk. If offered, cats often like to drink milk because it�s fresh and cold, and some may enjoy the taste. You should feed it with a diet abundant in calories and always provide heat sources to keep them warm in the cooler seasons.</p>
