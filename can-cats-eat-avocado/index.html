The truth is avocado does have something called persin in it which is a toxin, but it’s not believed to be poisonous to cats. They contain lots of vitamins k, c and magnesium. Turns out, if your dog eats a little avocado (free of pits, skin, and leaves), there’s likely no real obstruction issue and no reason to panic. Though it is a healthy fruit for humans is it also safe for your cats.</p>
