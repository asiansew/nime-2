Raw pulp is not tasty, is slimy, stringy, and difficult to chew and swallow by cats. But, you should not add any added sugar and spice to pumpkin. Don’t use pumpkin pie filling, or any canned pumpkin that contains other ingredients, such as sugars and/or flavorings.</p>

<p>Only pure and fresh pumpkin is safe for cats. But, you should not add any added sugar and spice to pumpkin. Can cats eat pumpkin seeds? Technically, you could also cook and then puree fresh pumpkin for your cat, but this may require more time and effort than you bargained for. This is especially beneficial for obese cats who are on a diet.</p>

<p>Add only a small amount of pumpkin: Make sure you aren�t feeding raw pumpkin or the pumpkin pie mix. Cats can eat pumpkin seeds as long as they’ve been cleaned and roasted at 350°f for an hour so. Pumpkin isn’t only good for making the classic pumpkin pie! However, this does not mean that cats do not enjoy small portions of them.</p>
