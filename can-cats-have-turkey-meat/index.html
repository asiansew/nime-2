<p>A lot of people who have cats worry about not providing their cats with enough taurine. Another hidden danger of feeding turkey to pets is the ingestion of cooking twine, which many people wrap their turkey in and can cause intestinal obstruction when eaten, especially by cats. Remove uneaten turkey after 20 minutes. Your cat can actually benefit greatly from turkey meat consumption, it contains many of the nutrients felines need in order to have a healthy development. Feeding your cat closer to earth is good for him/her however you will still want to give dry or wet food as well so that they are getting the other nutriants they need.</p>
