<p>In the spring and summer months, reports often arise about humans being poisoned by wild mushrooms. Most nuts remain as a bad choice for dogs, and some are very toxic. Any fungi is not a good food for cats, be it the one in your garden or the ones you find in a forest. September is national mushroom month, so it’s a good time to talk about when it’s safe to share mushrooms with your cat. Dogs explore the world by scent and taste, and the texture of a mushroom might also be intriguing to an inquisitive canine.</p>

<p>Mushrooms are not only a delicious accompaniment to many foods but are increasingly becoming a meat alternative for vegetarians and vegans. But can dogs eat mushrooms? As the weather gets warmer, the animal poison control center (apcc) wants you to be aware that mushrooms are not just a poisoning concern for humans, but for your pets as well. You should never feed them to your cats. Mushrooms are an excellent source of protein, vitamins, and nutrients.</p>
