<p>Parvo is extremely hardy and can survive on areas infected with feces indoors for at least a month and outdoors for up to a year under the right conditions. Parvovirus b19 can also spread through blood or blood products. Dog’s can catch parvo whenever they come into direct contact with the virus, not just the infected dog. If you already have another dog or you do not want to wait so long to adopt a new pet there are some effective ways to disinfect the home from the parvovirus. Sick cats won’t infect dogs, nor will sick dogs infect cats.</p>
