<p>And the cat�s in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue and the man on the moon when you comin� home? son, i don�t know when. When the song cat�s in the cradle came on the radio in 1975, i could relate to it and felt that my life was a mirror image of the song. Through all the pain as a teenager, i felt comforted by the song as it was a warning to my dad that if he continued to be distant emotionally, then one day i would not have time for him. He doesn�t play a good role as a dad but his son still looks up to him. Although originally intended to be poem, its lyrical and rhythmic nature has led to it becoming regarded as one of the most successful folk rock songs.</p>
