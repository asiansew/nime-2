<p>This is a list of riverclan cats who appear in the game. After a certain point in the original game (after brokenstar) your character can go to the nettle patch and and choose to recruit one of the listed cats as your allies. (also, i will be doing these for the other clans as well) In the original, new prophecy, and power of three games, there are many different characters that the player can choose to add to his/her team throughout the game, each with his/her own unique movesets. The cats leap into battle, and a thunderclan patrol comes by and assists the four cats.</p>
