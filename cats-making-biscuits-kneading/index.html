Once cats are mature enough to go without their mum’s milk, they may continue kneading when they feel at ease, as an instinctual reminder of those cozy days of youthful teat sucking. Kneading can become a habit if the cat does it quite often.</p>

<p>First of all, what is cat kneading? Kneading can become a habit if the cat does it quite often. That�s why we see adult cats making biscuits when they find a soft blanket or fresh, clean laundry. Typically a cat kneads—or “makes biscuits,” as some folks call it—into soft surfaces like pillows, beds and rugs. Kneading actually plays an important role in life when your cat is just a kitten.</p>

<p>Kneading and biting a blanket. Cats aren’t too picky when it comes to choosing where they want to make muffins. The cat will push out and pull in their front paws, often alternating between right and left limbs. Jump to navigation jump to search. If you’re curious to learn more about your cat’s behavior, let’s dive deeper into why cats knead and what this adorable habit of “making biscuits” may indicate.</p>

<p>Some cats knead and purr contentedly when they’re being petted, but they may also seem to do it for no clear reason. Some call it making biscuits or making bread because the motion of the cat�s paws looks like it is getting dough ready for the oven. Making biscuits, kneading dough, marching—whatever you call it, kneading is a weird cat quirk. Cats make muffins, also known as kneading or making muffins, because they are happy, comfortable, and safe in your home and environment. Though some of the cats will eventually grow out of it as they enter into adulthood, others may carry this habit throughout their life.</p>
