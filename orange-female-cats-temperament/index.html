Evidence is mostly anecdotal, but color and some aspects of temperament are genetic, so it’s certainly possible these traits are linked. Orange tabbies have reddish hair and striped markings. Indeed this specific dress is actually linked to a very rare gene in the male cat. Long haired breeds such as persians, maine coons and american curl can have the orange tabby pattern.</p>

<p>Tortoiseshell cats are over 99% of the time cats! Orange cats are visually appealing, but their temperament is determined by more than just coat color. Tortishell is a recessive gene on the x chromosome, so only females are torti and the males usually present as orange tabby. While male and female cats can be pretty similar in many ways, temperament is something that can vary between the two sexes. Male cats are xy but can be torties if they inherit an extra x chromosome (xxy).</p>
