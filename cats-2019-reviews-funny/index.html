Review by leah greenblatt december 18, 2019 at 07:00 pm est Cats is exactly as crazy as you thought it would be: Producer andrew lloyd weber has had multiple musicals take over broadway for decades and then eventually make their way to the silver screen.results have been mixed, but people were legitimately afraid of what would happen when it was announced a movie version of cats was being directed by tom hooper—and they had every right to be. Cats (2019) rated pg for some rude and suggestive humor.</p>

<p>Cats slips in right under the radar and easily scores as the bottom of the 2019 barrel — and arguably of the decade. The cats in cats (2019) will have realistic spiked penises. Plus, montegrappa is a company that mostly makes pens, so what this watch is doing out in the world, let alone on amazon, is beyond us. Dec 20 2019, 7:23 pm est there are good reviews, there are bad reviews, and then there are the cats reviews. Cats is exactly as crazy as you thought it would be:</p>
