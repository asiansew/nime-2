<p>Dangers for dogs and cats. Most cats will enjoy a taste of turkey meat! Cats are meat eaters and in general cooked and deli meats are ok for your cat to eat in small amounts. Food allergies, namely turkey allergies, are common in cats. Give your kitty some cooked beef, chicken, turkey, even deli meats from your local grocery store.</p>

<p>Another option is to freeze a juice box and to use that as an ice pack. Although cats love them, cured meats should only be given on occasion. Ground beef is cheap, easy to prepare and easy for cats to digest. Food allergies, namely turkey allergies, are common in cats. The dark meat of the turkey can cause pancreatitis in small dogs such as chihuahuas and yorkies.</p>

<p>Although ham is not the healthiest choice of meat that you can give your furry friend, your cat can still have ham. The symptoms often include vomiting and diarrhea. Make sure not to feed them raw or spoiled meats. These bacteria can disrupt their digestive system causing diarrhea or vomiting. Give your kitty some cooked beef, chicken, turkey, even deli meats from your local grocery store.</p>
