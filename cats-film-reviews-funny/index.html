<p>Reviews are in for the cats movie and stars including taylor swift and idris elba might want to look away now. Cats is in cinemas on. Cats was always an aberration. Other than that the cats were adorable and the movie was definitely worth watching. I�ll be adding this one to my collection.</p>

<p>Eliot’s source poems didn’t provide one. As a movie, cats doesn’t reach the level of suspended disbelief to be affecting or satisfying. The first thing to say about cats is that the cats themselves look fine. Tom hooper brings andrew lloyd webber�s feline musical to the big screen, starring judi dench, ian mckellen, taylor swift and more. Eliot’s source poems didn’t provide one.</p>

<p>There are good reviews, there are bad reviews, and then there are the cats reviews. It has funny scenes, sad scenes, and some pretty dark stuff. As a movie, cats doesn’t reach the level of suspended disbelief to be affecting or satisfying. Other than that the cats were adorable and the movie was definitely worth watching. The movie is apparently awful, so awful in fact that cats reviews have crossed over from being critical to being hilarious.</p>

<p>Movies are hardly ever about what they seem to be about. See the hilarious memes that spawned from critics� reviews of the new cats movie in the gallery above. This leaves a film with a lot of signing and dancing, a lacklustre plot and limited dialogue, as the movie crams a alwebber�s cats was a hugely popular stage show on the west end, broadway, and around the world. If you�re not familiar with the andrew lloyd webber musical, cats is based on old possum�s book of practical cats by t.s. Cats was always an aberration.</p>
